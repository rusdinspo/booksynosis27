<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>The Carolingians : A Family Who Forged Europe</h2><p><p>Pierre Rich� traces the emergence of Europe from the seventh to the early eleventh century, the period that witnessed the rise, fall, and revival of the Carolinian Empire. It was during this time the first contours of a broad new civilization and the first visible signs of European unity are discernable.</p><p>Until the seventh century Europe was simply a geographic term; as Isidore of Seville defined it, Europe was "the space that extended from the river Don to Spain and the Atlantic." By the ninth century, however, Europe had gradually acquired a collective being with a shared identity. The political, cultural, and spiritual activity of laymen and churchmen had fostered the creation of a common European fold, which stretched from the Atlantic to the Vistula, and the plains of the middle Danube.</p><p>The transformation was due in large part to the Carolinians, their relations, and their allies, who together became the masters of Gaul and then much of the West. Rich� traces the destiny of the Carolingians and the parallel history of Europe, stressing the roles of the leaders who imposed themselves by force, diplomacy, and culture.</p></p><p>Pierre Riche is Professor Emeritus of Medieval History at the University of Paris X (Nanterre) and Former Director of the Center for Research in Late Antiquity and the High Middle Ages. He is the author of Daily Life in the World of Charlemagne, also available from the University of Pennsylvania Press.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Paddling Southern Minnesota: 85 Great Trips by Canoe and Kayak (Trails Books Guide)</h2><p>If you think Minnesota paddling begins and ends in the Boundary Waters, you have a pleasant surprise in store. Here is your guide to 85 adventures on the rivers and streams of the Gopher State&#39;s southern half. Detailed maps, plenty of great photography, and trip descriptions that enlighten you to the water conditions, wildlife, history and scenic beauty along the way.</p><p></p><h2>The Nautical Chart</h2><p>Coy is a sailor without a ship.T�nger Soto is a woman with an obsession to find the Dei Gloria, a ship sunk during the seventeenth century, and El Piloto is an old man with the sailboat on which all three set out to seek their fortune together. Or do they? <br></p><p>A treasure hunt for a Jesuit ship sunk by pirates off the coast of Spain is the plot on which Perez-Reverte's new novel turns, but a love story is the real heart of this nicely crafted, carefully told adventure. A suspended sailor happens on a maritime auction in Barcelona, where he meets the beautiful Tanger Soto, a museum curator whose winning bid buys her a 17th-century atlas that may reveal the final resting place of the <i>Dei Gloria</i>. Coy, the sailor, is totally smitten, so it's no surprise that he signs on to help Tanger track the sunken ship to its grave in waters he's sailed since childhood. Enlisting the aid of a diver friend, Coy and Tanger stay a few steps ahead of the crooked salvagers who've been trying to get the atlas, outmaneuvering the attempts on their lives and the efforts to keep them from the treasure. Perez-Reverte (<i>The Fencing Master</i>, <i>The Club Dumas</i>) is better at plumbing the mysteries of the human heart than those of the sea, but <i>The Nautical Chart</i> manages to combine history, suspense, and obsessive love in a slow-paced but ultimately engrossing read. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Published in hardcover by Harcourt, 2001, 0-15-100534-6<br>Published in paperback by Harcourt, 2002, 0-15-601305-3 <br></p><h2>Confessions: The Paris Mysteries (Confessions, 3)</h2><p><b>In this <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, brilliant detective Tandy Angel is meeting her lost love in Paris . . . but when he becomes more distant, she starts to question everything she knows.

Street smart, with a quick wit and a larger-than-life personality, Nick is the go-to guy, the owner of Catini's Hardware who's there to score friends tickets to the big game or fix his daughters' problems. Every Sunday, Nick presides over the family dinner, dishing out sauce and advice with equal abandon. It is a time for family, for grandchildren, for men watching football in the living room while the women gossip and plan in the kitchen. It is a time to remember what matters most in life. Sunday is the best day of the week, and nobody can imagine it without Nick.</p><p>But when Nick is suddenly gone, that is exactly what they have to do--go on without him. For his girls--Maria, Nina, and Gina--it means learning to stand on their own feet while arguing about whether or not their mother, Teresa, can date again. For Teresa, it means trying somehow to keep her family together, even as she wonders what it would be like to find love again. And for her carefree son, Johnny, it means making good on his father's last request, a secret with the power to heal Johnny's guarded heart, if it doesn't destroy his family in the process.</p><p>Now, as the first leaves of fall stick to the wet streets of New England, as the winter snow melts into the pastel hues of spring, and everything seems new and different, the Catinis will be tested and changed as never before. For what seems like an insurmountable loss just may be the beginning of the best part of their lives. . .</p><p>At once both funny and heartwarming, with one of the most unique, unforgettable narrators to come along in years, <i>Every Sunday</i> is a warm, winning novel rich in hope, wisdom and the surprising strength of second chances.</p><p><b>Outstanding Praise For Peter Pezzelli And Home To Italy<br>A BookSense Pick! </b></p><p>"A beautiful novel.&nbsp; .&nbsp; .Peter Pezzelli captures the warmth of Italy--family, friendships, and food--invites us into the world of his wonderful characters, and takes us full circle on a journey of life and love."<br> --Luanne Rice, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author</p><p>"A delightful story of second chances."<br>--Desert Morning News</p><p>"Big-hearted and wise, Home to Italy is a charming ode to the romance of new beginnings and the Italian gusto for life.

Posing as a water expert to report on al-Qaeda activity in the area, he now faces extreme privation, mock executions, and forced marches through the arid badlands of Somalia. Thousands of miles away on the Greenland Sea, Danielle Flinders, a biomathematician, half-French, half-Australian, prepares to dive in a submersible to the ocean floor. She is obsessed with the life that multiplies in the darkness of the lowest strata of water.<p></p><p>Both are drawn back to the previous Christmas, and to a French hotel on the Atlantic coast, where a chance encounter on the beach led to an intense and enduring romance. For James, his mind escapes to utopias both imagined and remembered. Danny is drawn back to beginnings: to mythical and scientific origins, and to her own. It is to each other and to the ocean that they most frequently return: magnetic and otherworldly, a comfort and a threat.</p><p><b>J. M. Ledgard</b> was born in the Shetland Islands.

But it also offers so much more: Weird facts, astonishing sentences, deeply unfamiliar (to me) characters, and big ideas about time and space and science and love." <b><i> Slate, "Against YA"</i></b><br><br>"<i>[Submergence]</i> is, variously, a love story, martyrology, heresiography, science book, and spy novel. Like its Twitter supporters, who spoke in rapturous terms, I was sucked into the novel right away, from its commanding first line 'It was a bathroom in an unfinished house in Somalia in the year 2012?' to its final epigraph from Horace: 'Plunge it in deep water: it comes up more beautiful.' . . . I am very enthusiastic about this novel, because I found it transporting. . . . its ecological meditations are deep, its imagery sublime." <b><i> The Millions</i></b><br><br>"J.M.

Ledgard&#x2019;s <i>Submergence</i> is meditative, the threat of violence both manmade and in the natural world looms heavily. . . . Ledgard is less interested in the thriller-esque aspects of the book, and more in their philosophical implications.&#x201d;<b><i> Vol. 1 Brooklyn</i></b><br><br>"Elegant and assured. . . The brilliance of Ledgard is in his willingness to plead ignorance. He understands that the enormity of the universe eludes human comprehension. To encapsulate its mysteries in a massive tome would be like trying to capture moonlight in a shoebox.

Being inside the pool and imagining the water on your body is subtly different from thinking about the water while standing next to the pool. This difference, felt in all our senses, tells us something about how we see the world in ways that we often find hard to describe. Reading J.M. Ledgard&#x2019;s <i>Submergence</i> is just like that.

Until now, however, many of the most important visual and textual sources on the topic have remained untranslated or otherwise difficult to consult. Mary Carruthers and Jan M. Ziolkowski bring together the texts and visual images from the twelfth through the fifteenth centuries that are central to an understanding of memory and memory technique.

The mixing of visual and verbal media was commonplace throughout medieval cultures: pictures contained visual puns, words were often verbal paintings, and both were used equally as tools for making thoughts. The ability to create pictures in one's own mind was essential to medieval cognitive technique and imagination, and the intensely pictorial and affective qualities of medieval art and literature were generative, creative devices in themselves.</p></p><p>Mary Carruthers is Professor Emeritus of English at New York University.

In paperback format and enriched with a new last chapter, this book has the potential to revolutionize the way we look at babies, both before and after birth. Part I is filled with "user-friendly" information about the mind and abilities of newborns, as well as a thorough look at their development before birth. Parts II and III present evidence that babies do remember birth and are very much aware of the people around them at that time. Dr. Chamberlain writes compellingly about the newborn's sensitivity, awareness, and vulnerability. He emphasizes the importance and power of the infant-and-parent connection during pregnancy and after birth. When the information in this book becomes common knowledge, we will look at our children with new respect and understanding.</p><p>Dr. David Chamberlain is a psychologist, President of the Association for Pre- and Perinatal Psychology and Health (APPPAH), Editor of www.birthpsychology.com, and author of over 30 scholarly publications.

In doing so, he saved the development of Western civilization and inspired the birth of the marathon as we know it. Even now, some 2,500 years later, that run stands enduringly as one of greatest physical accomplishments in the history of mankind. <br><br>Karnazes personally honors Pheidippides and his own Greek heritage by recreating this ancient journey in modern times. Karnazes even abstains from contemporary endurance nutrition like sports drinks and energy gels and only eats what was available in 490 BCE, such as figs, olives, and cured meats. Through vivid details and internal dialogs, <i>The Road to Sparta</i> offers a rare glimpse into the mindset and motivation of an extreme athlete during his most difficult and personal challenge to date. This story is sure to captivate and inspire&#x2014;whether you run great distances or not at all.</p><p>Dean Karnazes, a <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author and an internationally recognized endurance athlete, was named by <i>Time</i> magazine as one of the Top 100 Most Influential People in the World.

Now in his autumn years, Gus was gregarious and spirited, but his life hadn't always been so carefree. Fifty years earlier, at the fresh age of 14, he'd arrived on American shores with 20 bucks in his pocket and not a word of English in his vocabulary. Since adolescence he'd been forced to fend for himself, alone and in a foreign land.<br><br>Enterprising and hardworking, Gus followed his instincts across the country, venturing wherever opportunity could be found and eventually settling on the West Coast, in Los Angeles. There, he met a beautiful young lady, Vasiliki, and they fell madly in love. He couldn't stand being without her. One night he appeared outside her bedroom window. "Billy, Billy," he tapped on the pane, "it's me, Gus. Open up."<br><br>She heard the rapping and slid the window open. "Gus, what are you doing here?"<br><br>"I've come to take your hand in marriage."<br><br>"But I can't."<br><br>He was puzzled. "Why? Do you not love me?"<br><br>"Yes, I love you deeply."<br><br>"Then why will you not marry me?"<br><br>"Because my oldest sister has yet to marry."<br><br>"Oh." Gus scratched his head as she slid the window shut.<br><br>He thought about the situation for a second and then moved over to the adjacent window. He tapped on it, and Eugenia's face appeared. Gus waved his hand back and forth several times, "Sorry, sorry." Eugenia was the middle sister.<br><br>He moved over one more time and knocked on a third window. Panayota looked out at him.<br><br>"Pack your bags," he told her. "We're going to get married."<br><br>She did as he asked and then crawled out the window. They eloped to Mexico that night.<br><br>Ironically, Panayota's family (or Patricia, as she was known) had emigrated from a region not far from Gus's origins. The two of them got along well together. Eventually, they raised a family of three children.<br><br>As the years passed, Gus invested his earnings from the restaurant business into acquiring rental properties, eventually building a portfolio sufficient to provide for his family and live a comfortable life in the flourishing metropolis of LA. A proud man who had come from nothing, it was quite gratifying to him to have created such a stable foundation for himself and his loved ones--the American dream come true.<br><br>Yet, despite all that he'd accomplished and everything he'd achieved, Gus remained perpetually restless. An incessant fire burned within the man. To him, it always seemed there was more that could be done; there were greater challenges still to be conquered. He would not permit himself to stop or to slow down, perpetually resisting any temptation to rest. His philosophy was: Show me a man who is content, and I will show you an underachiever. Gus was never quite satisfied with his place in the world. He was constantly striving to do more and to be more, though he wasn't always quite sure how to go about it.<br><br>Some of this pent-up ferocity was released through participation in sports and athletics. An avid wrestler, Gus dabbled in the professional arena back in an era when wrestling was a more noble pursuit. Athleticism was important in his ancient culture, and those virtues stuck with him even in America. His opponents used to say that getting in the ring with Gus was like wrestling Hercules. He earned a reputation for being a mighty fighter, fearless, even when taking on opponents twice his size. His colossal chest and huge arms were imposing enough, but his legs, especially his calves, were so shockingly overdeveloped that Gus often had to have the legs of his trousers widened to fit over his calves.<br><br>Because he remained physically active throughout his life, the years had been mostly kind to him. Bronze-skinned and chisel-cheeked, with a full head of wavy, silver hair, Gus looked the part of a Hollywood movie star. But like many immigrants, his diet had progressively shifted from one of lean meats and freshly harvested vegetables to one of heavily fatted, fried, and overly salted foods. It was the American way. And besides, it tasted better.<br><br>Returning home one bright and sunny afternoon, he burst through the front door and lightheartedly called out, "Patricia! Where is my lovely bride?"<br><br>It was a jovial, good-natured call he routinely sang out upon returning home, even though they'd been married for 32 years. Despite decades together, Gus still maintained a playful side. After all, wasn't that what life was about? No amount of hard work could dampen this spirit; every glorious day was cause for celebration. This is what he'd been taught as a boy. It was the way of the land he had come from before arriving in America.<br><br>Suddenly, something peculiar occurred. The muscles in his left arm started pulsing rather strangely. Gus cocked his head--what was this? The sensation quickly spread to his neck, and then farther up to his jaw. He stood silently, attempting to appraise the situation. Rather abruptly, his arm went entirely numb. He shook it several times, but the feeling did not return. What was this?<br><br>In that instant a crushing tightness squeezed his chest, as though an opponent in the wrestling ring had him in a body lock. The iron grip became so constrictive he could barely breathe. Staggering to reach the kitchen, he dropped to one knee. Gus was not a man to be seen on his knees. He thrust his arm upward in an attempt to grab the counter for stability, but his mighty arm did not cooperate, and he crumpled downward.<br><br>Now he was furious. "Arm, work!" he roared. "Do not forsake me arm; work!"<br><br>Blood coursed through his body in anger, but still there was no response from his arm. He would have none of this. He would not have his wife find him lying in an undignified heap on the kitchen floor as though pinned and defeated by a rival. This had never happened to him in the ring, and he would not permit it to happen to him now.<br><br>"If you do not lift me, arm, I will cut you off," he shouted. "Now, WORK!"<br><br>But his arm would not respond. He could not pry himself off the ground.<br><br>The door to the kitchen swung open. Patricia had heard the commotion and dashed in to see what was going on. She found him lying on the ground.<br><br>"Gus! What is happening?" She knew right away that something was terribly amiss.<br><br>"Patricia," he snarled, nostrils flaring, "bring me a knife!"<br><br>She looked down at him, quizzically. His request confused her. Patricia was a slight woman, of fair olive skin and light hazel eyes. Their union had begun as a convoluted one--after all, he had originally fallen in love with her youngest sister--though she had always found him quite handsome, albeit a bit gruff and unrefined. No matter, she had sensed that their relationship would endure despite their unexpected union, and her intuition had been true. They'd been happily married since the day she crawled out her bedroom window.<br><br>Gus broke the silence. "Bring me a knife, I tell you. I must cut off my arm!"<br><br>Now she was concerned. She slowly stepped back. "I . . . am . . ."<br><br>Walking backward, still staring down at him in grave concern, she said, "I am calling for help."<br><br>"There's no need for that!" he yelled, eyebrows furrowed in rage. "Just do as I ask. Bring me a knife and I will cut off this uncooperative arm, and we can go about our day."<br><br>She started to tremble. Distraught, she didn't know what to do, which wasn't like her. She always knew what to do, how to handle things. But this was different. Her husband's neck was growing increasingly purple, and the discoloration was spreading upward toward his face. Something was horribly wrong.<br><br>"Come to me, darling," he requested, in a tone that was now softer and more tender. What? She'd never heard such passive words coming from her husband's lips. "Come, hold me," he pleaded.<br><br>Never had she seen her husband scared before. Never had he allowed himself to display any overt sign of weakness. His ancestral pride would not permit such. She knelt down next to him, and he noticed that she was whimpering.<br><br>"Just hold me," he said. After 32 years of marriage, those were the final words exchanged between them before his body went limp.<br><br>So ended the life of Gus Gibbs. Just like that, 64 years of highs and lows, good times and bad, dreams realized and dashed, all came to an abrupt conclusion. The death certificate following the autopsy listed occlusive coronary artery disease as the cause, a heart attack. It was an all-too- common affliction cast upon those who'd adopted the new American diet, with its greasy fast food and other unhealthy offerings. Fatty deposits of plaque had literally blocked his arteries.<br><br>The only peculiarity on the death certificate was that it didn't list his name as Gus Gibbs, but instead as Constantine Nicholas Karnazes. Like many foreigners concerned about potentially suffering the stigma that attaches to recent immigrants, he'd chosen an alias in an effort to assimilate more smoothly. Why do I know all of this? I know it because Gus Gibbs was my namesake, my grandfather.</p><h2>Eating Dirt: Deep Forests, Big Timber, and Life with the Tree-Planting Tribe (David Suzuki Institute)</h2><p>Winner of the BC National Award for Canadian Non-Fiction<br> Winner of the 2012 Foreword Magazine Editor's Choice Prize Nonfiction<br> Shortlisted for the Hilary Weston Prize<br> Shortlisted for the Charles Taylor Non-Fiction Award<br><br><i>"Charlotte Gill writes with a dexterity and nobility that soars.

They are also of special interest not only for their theological value but for their sociological context. Among the communities established by Paul, the church at Thessalonica appears to have been the only one to have suffered serious external oppression. These two important epistles, then, speak uniquely to contemporary Christians living in a society often ideologically, if not politically, opposed to Christian faith.<br><br>In this innovative commentary Charles A. Wanamaker incorporates what may be called a social science approach to the study of 1 and 2 Thessalonians, taking into full account the social context that gave rise to Paul&#x2019;s correspondence. While Wanamaker in no way ignores traditional historical-critical, linguistic, literary, and theological approaches to writing a commentary -- in fact, at several points he makes a significant contribution to the questions raised by traditional exegesis -- at the same time he goes beyond previous commentaries on the Thessalonian correspondence by taking seriously the social dimensions both of Christianity at Thessalonica and of the texts of 1 and 2 Thessalonians themselves. In blending traditional exegetical methods with this newer approach, Wanamaker seeks to understand Pauline Christianity at Thessalonica as a socio-religious movement in the first-century Greco-Roman world and attempts to grasp the social character and functions of Paul&#x2019;s letters within this context.<br><br>A significant and original addition to the literature on 1 and 2 Thessalonians, this commentary will be valuable to scholars, pastors, and students alike.</p><p></p><h2>Goosebumps Horrorland X 10 S W [Paperback] [Jan 01, 2011] R L Stine</h2><p>Revenge of The Living Dummy, Creep From The Deep, Monster Blood For Breakfast, The Scream Of The Haunted Mask, Dr Maniac Vs Robby Schwartz, Who&#39;s Your Mummy, My Friend Call Me Monster, Say Cheese- And Die Screaming!, Welcome To Camp Slither, Help!

But as spring training for the 2004 season drew to a close, the two young stars had yet to appear together on the same field.<br><br>Reyes was out with a pulled hamstring, and Matsui was sidelined with a strained wrist. Having gone 8 years in the Japanese major leagues without missing a game, Matsui, 28, had been considered something of an iron man. But Reyes, only 20, had already become an orthopaedics frequent flier.<br><br>During his rookie year, Reyes was benched three times with hamstring trouble, a problem that began for him at age 14. As a youngster back home in the Dominican Republic, Reyes had been running up the stadium steps to strengthen his legs when he heard something snap. Trouble is, once you pull a hamstring, chances are you will do it again. That's because the muscle heals with scar tissue where healthy cells used to be. Early on in the rehab process, you can reduce the negative effects of that scarring, but it takes a lot of time and a lot of conscientious effort. Once the muscle heals, if you haven't taken full advantage of that window of opportunity, then you get far denser scar tissue with no elasticity. If you look at the muscle under a microscope, instead of the bands lining up parallel and behaving like a spring or bungee cord, the structure is more haphazard, which makes it a lot less flexible, and thus more vulnerable--a weak link.<br><br>For Reyes, quick, darting movements and sudden lunges are his stock in trade. These movements require sudden contraction of the quadriceps, the muscle in the front of the thigh. This, in turn, requires a quick relaxation and lengthening (eccentric contraction) of the hamstring, the muscle in the back of the thigh. Unless a strong quad is balanced with an equally strong and flexible hamstring, the imbalance is bound to cause trouble.<br><br>Whether you play second base or second fiddle, whether you crank miles on the track or code on your computer, you need a frame you can count on. That's why the modern definition of fitness isn't just aerobic capacity, or muscle tone, or the absence of fat. True fitness needs to be from the foundation up, and that means fitness for all the cells and tissues that make up your musculoskeletal frame.<br><br>In the old days of baseball, Babe Ruth played until he was 40, but the photographs show an old man with spindly legs and a potbelly, to some extent coasting on his legend. The classic sports novel North Dallas Forty, written in the 1970s, portrayed thirty-something pro football players as broken-down old men, hobbling to the stadium, then numbing themselves with painkillers and injections to get through a game. Famous as a great running back before he became infamous as a criminal defendant, O. J. Simpson could be the poster child for this old-school approach to fitness. At his trial for the murder of his wife and her companion, the defense argued that this once great athlete had so many bone and joint injuries, especially to his knees and ankles, that he could barely walk, much less overpower two healthy people! No amount of conditioning is going to fully protect a knee in the National Football League, but today's superstars have redefined conditioning and, as a result, are redefining athletic staying power.<br><br>In 2003, Sports Illustrated described Oakland Raiders receiver Jerry Rice, then 39, as having "carved up the New York Jets' secondary like a honey- baked ham." In that one game, this "middle-aged man" had nine catches for 183 yards and a touchdown.<br><br>That same year, in the National Basketball League, 4 days after turning 40, Michael Jordan scored 43 points in 43 minutes, helping his Washington Wizards defeat the New Jersey Nets, 89-86. He had 10 rebounds, four steals, burst past the opposition to make the game-winning layup, and dived to the floor to save the ball after making a first-quarter steal.<br><br>When iron man pitcher Nolan Ryan threw his seventh no-hitter at age 44, and Cal Ripken hung in for 2,632 consecutive games, they were pioneers in terms of durability. But as of 2003, major league baseball had 11 players over 40. As the 2004 baseball season began, Roger Clemens, 41, was still throwing a 96 mph fastball. And on May 17, 2004, Randy Johnson (age 41) warmed the hearts of aging jocks everywhere by pitching a perfect game against the Atlanta Braves, sending 27 youngsters back to the bench without a single hit. In his next outing, against the Florida Marlins, "the Big Unit," as Johnson is called, continued his streak for three more innings before giving up a hit, making a total of 39 batters retired in a row--two short of the major league record. Not bad for an old guy.<br><br>Track and field has Regina Jacobs, who at age 40 broke the world indoor record for 1,500 meters. Golf has Jay Haas, who in the spring of 2004--at age 50--was playing so well that some had him pegged to win the Masters. Hockey has Mario Lemieux, who came out of retirement, overcoming cancer and chronic back problems, to captain the Pittsburgh Penguins at age 37. And tennis has Martina Navratilova, who in 2003, at age 46, became the oldest player to win a championship (mixed doubles) at Wimbledon. In 2004, she became the oldest person to win a singles match at Wimbledon!<br><br>Part of the reason for this athletic longevity is that these players entered the world of serious athletics at a time when serious conditioning was coming into fashion.<br><br>Unfortunately, the benefit still hasn't reached everyone.<br><br>Too many great young athletes--University of Connecticut basketball's All- American Shea Ralph is a perfect example--see their dreams shattered for no other reason than a faulty frame.<br><br>SIDELINED BY A FAULTY FRAME<br><br>Former basketball great Shea Ralph could be the poster girl for the epidemic of knee injuries among female athletes. She's also living proof that no matter how much talent and heart you bring to the game, it doesn't get the job done if your frame gives out on you.<br><br>This tall blonde from North Carolina was a dream player with a brilliant future in women's basketball. In 1995-96, she was USA Today's "High School Player of the Year." In 1996-97, she was "Freshman of the Year" in Sporting News and "Big East Conference Rookie of the Year." In 2000, she was captain of the University of Connecticut women's basketball team that won the NCAA Championship. In 2000, Shea Ralph was an All-American, as well as MVP of the Final Four.<br><br>But when it came time to turn pro, and Ralph was drafted by the WNBA's Utah Starzz, she was never able to play. By the end of her college career, Shea had lost her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) on both sides. In all, she has had to endure six different knee operations.<br><br>Her troubles began in the first round of the 1997 NCAA tournament when a fast break turned into an agonized tear in her right ACL. Three days later she had her first reconstructive surgery.<br><br>The following year she was redshirted after reinjuring that same knee during a workout. She had her second ACL surgery in September 1997.<br><br>It wasn't until 1998-99 that Ralph had her first collegiate start--she made up for lost time by scoring 36 points against Boston College. But then she missed four games with a sprained medial collateral ligament, again in the right knee.<br><br>In 2000, Connecticut won all the marbles, and things were looking good for Ralph's career. Then, in March, 2001, during the first half of a game against Notre Dame for the Big East Championship, she went in for a layup along the baseline, and the crack could be heard throughout the gym--only this time it was her left knee! Another ACL tear.<br><br>Today, Shea Ralph contents herself with being assistant coach of the University of Pittsburgh women's basketball team.<br><br>In an interview with the New York Times, Ralph said that, for a while, she was so bitter about her injuries that she could not even watch basketball on television. Since that low, she's found ways to bounce back and throw herself into the challenges of coaching. But she admits, "I still miss it. I won't lie to you. I really, really would have loved to play pro." We now know that many ACL tears can be prevented by changing the way you condition your frame.<br><br>AVOIDING WEAK LINKS<br><br>Torn cartilage in the knee or a stress fracture can harm you, whereas a bruise and a small hematoma (swelling) from a kick will merely hurt. A certain degree of hurt is okay--it's the harm you have to watch out for.<br><br>The danger of letting "hurt" continue until it causes harm is that, even when the injury can be "repaired," it often leaves you with a structural flaw, a weak link--like Jose Reyes's scarred hamstring--that makes you vulnerable to further injury.<br><br>We all have these vulnerabilities in our frames: structural flaws, some big, some small. Some are obvious and/or symptomatic--others quiet, asymptomatic, lurking beneath the skin, waiting for the right circumstance to rear their ugly heads. Many stay quiet for a lifetime but all have the potential to give you grief.<br><br>Weak links come in many varieties and can be from:<br><br>An old injury or ailment that leaves a structural flaw<br><br>Imbalances in musculature or flexibility that put stress on particular joints<br><br>Incomplete rehabilitation of an old or new injury or ailment<br><br>Alignment or anatomy problems<br><br>Genetics<br><br>Tissue changes resulting from aging or other causes<br><br>Your mindset or attitude<br><br>Your program design or exercise technique<br><br>Many injuries do not completely rehabilitate, something we call IRS, or incomplete rehabilitation syndrome. It takes a lot of work to get back to 100 percent (or as close as possible) after an injury, and most of us stop around 80 to 85 percent when our bodies think they feel okay (i.e., when the swelling is down and the limp goes away). This is a big mistake. Playing at 80 percent often means reinjury.<br><br>Likewise, imbalances in strength, flexibility, or both can be a major setup for bone and joint problems. Most of us are at least a little out of balance, which is why your alignment, genetic makeup, or changes that occur from aging also create vulnerabilities in your frame. The weak links that upset me perhaps the most, and are probably the most preventable, are those we inflict upon ourselves with a negative mindset or poorly designed workouts. The importance of all this is that a chain, or should I say your frame, is only as strong as its weakest link. Find those weak links and toughen them, and you are ready to go the distance.<br><br>You have to construct your exercise program to work around, or through, your own, distinctive weak links. By my estimation, 80 percent of the adult population needs some degree of customization of their exercise programs to accommodate their weak links. In the self-test in Chapter 4, I'll help you identify your weak links. Then in the exercise routines, I'll show you how to work around them.<br><br>YOUR CHEATIN' BOD<br><br>Once again, with any form of exercise, you're sculpting your frame for good or ill. The more you do, the more it pays to do it right and make your exercise specific to your objective. But as we develop weak links, our bodies try to find the easy way out, which does not help the cause.<br><br>I once saw the legendary Rudolf Nureyev dance on a night when I could tell that his foot was really bothering him. This was at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia, and after the curtain I went backstage where he asked for my advice. He told me he was worried about a "student of his" who was having trouble with an arthritic great toe--a significant problem for someone who jumps for a living. As we talked further and established a bit of trust, eventually he confessed that the dancer with the toe problem was himself.<br><br>Of course, I knew that--I'd been watching him all evening trying to compensate for that painful foot.<br><br>A master like Nureyev has a thousand tricks to distract your eye from the problem area, but whenever someone has an injury or imbalance, the body tries to pull off the same magic act. It happens so subtly that usually we're not even aware of it. The body starts cheating a little, and compensating a lot, until all the cheating and compensating create a huge problem.<br><br>Dancers who don't have a natural hip turnout, who force their turnout, try to compensate. They rotate the shin around more so that the knee and foot is what is turning out, when the turnout should come at the hip. The knee twist that some use to compensate wreaks havoc. A dancer can rotate her foot around and can drop and destroy her arch and midfoot area, create a bunion, or even damage tendons around the ankle.<br><br>The body finds a way, even when you're not conscious of it, and it can happen in almost any sport or fitness activity.<br><br>A painful or impinged bone in the foot can throw off your gait, which can throw out your lower back. Loss of range of motion in your shoulder can cause distortion, not just in your golf or tennis swing, but in the musculature all across your upper torso. Favoring your right knee can cause you to sprain your left ankle. It can also cause your right quadriceps to shrink in circumference by an inch or two.<br><br>This is why mindfulness in your exercise becomes so important, because all too often, you think you are doing the right thing, but your body is cheating and compensating all of your muscles. When people have had a knee injury or kneecap pain, and they do leg lifts to strengthen the quad muscles, they don't get the benefit because their body cheats, using the hip to lift the leg rather than the important quadriceps muscle.<br><br>That's why, in this book, I'll show you modifications to prevent you from cheating your body. For example, if you have knee pain while doing simple leg lifts, I'll teach you the modification called "lock and lifts." For people coming off surgery or kneecap pain, it's a smart, effective way to strengthen the thigh without irritating the kneecap.</p><h2>Double Cross (FBI: Houston)</h2><p>FBI Agent Laurel Evertson&#x2019;s investigation into a scam targeting the elderly takes an unexpected twist when key evidence leads her to Morton Wilmington, a felon she arrested five years ago on her first undercover assignment.

Do you believe women are human beings and that they deserve to be treated as such? That women deserve all the same rights and liberties bestowed upon men? If so, then you are a feminist . . . or so the feminists keep insisting. But somewhere along the way, the movement for female liberation sacrificed meaning for acceptance, and left us with a banal, polite, ineffectual pose that barely challenges the status quo. In this bracing, fiercely intelligent manifesto, Jessa Crispin demands more.<br><br><i>Why I Am Not A Feminist </i>is a radical, fearless call for revolution. It accuses the feminist movement of obliviousness, irrelevance, and cowardice&#x2014;and demands nothing less than the total dismantling of a system of oppression.<br><b>Praise for Jessa Crispin, and <i>The Dead Ladies Project<br></i></b><br>"I'd follow Jessa Crispin to the ends of the earth." --Kathryn Davis, author of<i> Duplex</i><br><br>"Read with caution . . .

But it was a victory won by defiance of the Capitol and their harsh rules. Katniss and Peeta should be happy. After all, they have just won for themselves and their families a life of safety and plenty. But there are rumors of rebellion among the subjects, and Katniss and Peeta, to their horror, are the faces of that rebellion. The Capitol is angry. The Capitol wants revenge.<br><br>Suzanne Collins continues the amazing story of Katniss Everdeen in this second novel of the phenomenal Hunger Games trilogy.</p><p>Suzanne Collins is the author of the groundbreaking Hunger Games trilogy for young adults: The Hunger Games, Catching Fire, and Mockingjay. She is also the author of the picture book Year of the Jungle, a Publishers Weekly Best Book of the Year, and the New York Times bestselling Underland Chronicles series for middle-grade readers, which started with Gregor the Overlander. Suzanne lives with her family in Connecticut. You can find her online at suzannecollinsbooks.com.This story and audio fulfill the promise of the stunning debut in this series, THE HUNGER GAMES, in which a cruel contest required 24 young people to fight in mortal combat. Carolyn McCormick delivers the first-person narrative of Katniss, the heroine whose brilliant strategy in that book thwarted tradition and turned her and her partner, Peeta, into victors. McCormick&#39;s phrasing is clipped, almost staccato, a style that embodies Katniss&#39;s secretive, wary attitudes. The tension builds as the oppression of the controlling President Snow inflames rebellion in Katniss and her fellow citizens. At the climax McCormick narrates at a breakneck pace as Katniss and Peeta compete against all previous winners of the combat tournament. Listeners will be eager for the next installment. S.W.

From the seemingly bombed-out ravages of his neighborhood, wracked by drugs, poverty, and violence, he managed to extract an incredibly positive energy from this riot ridden era: his multiracial gang promoted peace rather than violence. After initiating a gang truce, the Ghetto Brothers held weekly concerts on the streets or in abandoned buildings, which fostered the emergence of hip-hop. Melendez also began to reclaim his Jewish roots after learning about his family's dramatic crypto-Jewish background.&nbsp;</p><p><p><b>Julian Voloj</b> is a photographer and writer who explores aspects of identity and cultural heritage through his work.

I had already written almost thirty Regency romances, character-driven comedies of manners, all set in England. I was comfortable in the genre.

It was a country entertainment and the numbers not large, there being only two guests staying at the house at that particular time to swell the ranks of the local gentry.</p><p>It was not a ball, but the boy sitting out of sight of the house on the seat surrounding the great marble fountain below the terrace wished that he was inside and a part of it all. He wished that reality could be suspended and that he could be there dancing with <i>her, </i>the dark-haired, dark-eyed young daughter of his father&#x2019;s guest. Or at least looking at her and perhaps talking with her. Perhaps fetching her a glass of lemonade. He wished&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. oh, he wished for the moon, as he always did. A dreamer&#x2014;that was what his mother had often called him.</p><p>But there were two insurmountable reasons for his exclusion from the assembly: he was only seventeen years old, and he was the marquess&#x2019;s <i>illegitimate </i>son. That last fact had had particular meaning to him only during the past year and a half, since the sudden death of his mother. Through his childhood and much of his boyhood, it had seemed a normal way of life to have a father who visited him and his mother frequently but did not live with them, and a father who had a wife in the big house though no other children but him.</p><p>It was only in the year and a half since his mother&#x2019;s death that the reality of his situation had become fully apparent to him. He had been a fifteen-year-old boy without a home and with a father who had financed his mother&#x2019;s home but had never been a permanent part of it. His father had taken him to live in the big house. But he had felt all the awkwardness of his situation since moving there. He was not a member of the family&#x2014;his father&#x2019;s wife, the marchioness, hated him and ignored his presence whenever she was forced to be in it. But he was not one of the servants either, of course.</p><p>It was only in the past year and a half that his father had begun to talk about his future and that the boy had realized that his illegitimacy made of that future a tricky business. The marquess would buy him a commission in the army when he was eighteen, he had decided, but it would have to be with a line regiment and not with the cavalry&#x2014;certainly not with the Guards. That would never do when the ranks of the Guards were filled with the sons of the nobility and upper gentry. The legitimate sons, that was.</p><p>He was his father&#x2019;s only son, but illegitimate.</p><p>&#x201c;You are not at the ball?&#x201d; a soft<i> </i>little voice asked him suddenly, and he looked up to see the very reason why he had so wished to be in the drawing room&#x2014;Jeanne Morisette, daughter of the Comte de Levisse, a royalist �migr� who had fled from France during the Reign of Terror and lived in England ever since.</p><p>He felt his heart thump. He had never been close to her before, had never exchanged a word with her. He shrugged. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to be,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It is not a ball anyway.&#x201d;</p><p>She sat down beside him, slender in a light-colored flimsy gown&#x2014;he could not see the exact color in the darkness&#x2014;her hair in myriad ringlets about her head, her eyes large and luminous in the moonlight. &#x201c;But I wish I could be there even so,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I thought I might be allowed to attend since it is just a country entertainment. But Papa said no. He said that fifteen is too young to be dancing with gentlemen. It is tiresome being young, is it not?&#x201d;</p><p>Ah. So she had not been with the company after all. He had tortured himself for nothing. He shrugged again. &#x201c;I am not so young,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I am seventeen.&#x201d;</p><p>She sighed. &#x201c;When I am seventeen,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;I shall dance every night and go to the theater and on picnics. I shall do just whatever I please when I am grown up.&#x201d;</p><p>Her face was bright and eager and she was prettier than any other girl he had seen. He had taken every opportunity during the past week to catch glimpses of her. She was like a bright little jewel, quite beyond his reach, of course, but lovely to look at and to dream of.</p><p>&#x201c;Papa is going to take me back to France as soon as it is safe to go,&#x201d; she said with a sigh. &#x201c;Everything seems to be settling down under the leadership of Napoleon Bonaparte. If it continues so, perhaps we will be able to return, Papa says. He says there is no point in continuing to dream of the return of a king.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So you may do your dancing in Paris,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; Her eyes were dreamy. &#x201c;But I would just as soon stay in London. I know England better than I know France. I even speak English better than I speak French. I would prefer to belong here.&#x201d;</p><p>But there was a trace of a French accent in her voice. It was one more attractive feature about her. He liked to listen to her talk.</p><p>&#x201c;You are the marquess&#x2019;s son, are you not?&#x201d; she asked him. &#x201c;But you do not have his name?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have my mother&#x2019;s name,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;She died the winter before last.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;that is sad. My mother is dead too, but I do not remember her. I have always been with Papa for as long as I recall. What is your name?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Robert,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Robert.&#x201d; She gave his name its French intonation and then smiled and said it again with its English pronunciation. &#x201c;Robert, dance with me. Do you dance?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My mother taught me,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Out here? How can we dance out here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Easily,&#x201d; she said, jumping lightly to her feet and stretching out a slim hand to him. &#x201c;The music is quite loud enough.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But you will hurt your feet on the stones,&#x201d; he said, looking down at her thin silk slippers as she led the way up onto the terrace.</p><p>She laughed. &#x201c;I think, Robert, that you are looking for excuses,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I think that your mother did not teach you at all, or that if she did, you were unteachable. I think perhaps you have two left feet.&#x201d; She laughed again.</p><p>&#x201c;That is not so,&#x201d; he said indignantly. &#x201c;If you wish to dance, then dance we will.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That is a very grudging acceptance,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You are supposed to be thrilled to dance with me. You are supposed to make me feel that there is nothing you wish for more in life than to dance with me. But no matter. Let us dance.&#x201d;</p><p>He knew very little about women&#x2019;s teasing. It was true that Mollie Lumsden, one of his father&#x2019;s undermaids, frequently put herself in his way and showed herself to him in provocative poses, most frequently bent over his bed as she made it up in the mornings. It was true too that on the one occasion when he had tried to steal a kiss she had whisked herself off with a toss of the head and an assurance that her favors did not come free. But there was a world of difference between the buxom Mollie and Jeanne Morisette.</p><p>They danced a minuet, the moon bathing the cobbles of the terrace in a mellow light, both of them silent and concentrating on the distant music and their steps&#x2014;although his attention was not entirely on just those two things either. His eyes were on the slender moonlit form of the girl with whom he danced. Her hand in his was warm and slim and soft. He thought that life might never have a finer moment to offer him.</p><p>&#x201c;You are very tall,&#x201d; she said as the music drew to an end.</p><p>He was close to six feet in height. Unfortunately his growing had all been done upward. To say that he was thin would be to understate the case. He hated to look at himself in a looking glass. He longed to be a handsome, muscular man and wondered if he ever would be anything more than gangly and ugly.</p><p>&#x201c;And you have lovely blond hair,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I have noticed you all week and wished that I had hair that waved like yours.&#x201d; She laughed lightly. &#x201c;I am glad you do not wear it short. It would be such a waste.&#x201d;</p><p>He was dazzled. He was still holding her soft little hand in his.</p><p>&#x201c;I am supposed to be in my room,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Papa would have forty fits if he knew I was out here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You are quite safe,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I shall see that no harm comes to you.&#x201d;</p><p>She looked up at him from beneath her lashes, an imp of mischief in her eyes. &#x201c;You may kiss me if you wish,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>His eyes widened. What Mollie had denied, Jeanne Morisette would grant? But how could he kiss her? He knew nothing about kissing.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;if you do not wish to, I shall return to the house. Perhaps you are afraid.&#x201d;</p><p>He was. Mortally afraid. &#x201c;Of course I am not afraid,&#x201d; he said scornfully. And he set his hands at her waist&#x2014; they almost met about it&#x2014;and lowered his head and kissed her. He kissed her as he had always kissed his mother on the cheek&#x2014;though he kissed Jeanne on the lips&#x2014;briefly and with a smacking sound.</p><p>She was all softness and subtle fragrance. And her hands were on his shoulders, her thumbs against the skin of his neck. Her dark eyes looked inquiringly into his. He swallowed and knew that his bobbing Adam&#x2019;s apple would reveal his nervousness.</p><p>&#x201c;And of course I wish to,&#x201d; he said, and he lowered his head and laid his lips against hers again, keeping them there for a few self-indulgent moments and noting with shock the unfamiliar effects of the embrace on his body&#x2014; the breathlessness, the rush of heat, the tightening in his groin. He lifted his head.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, Robert,&#x201d; she said with a sigh, &#x201c;you can have no idea how tiresome it is to be fifteen. Or can you? Do you remember what it was like? Though it is entirely different for a boy, of course. I am still expected to behave like a child, when I am not a child. I must be quiet and prim, and welcome the company of your father and mother&#x2014;no, the marchioness is not your mother, is she?&#x2014;and of my own papa. And I am to be denied the company of the young people who are at present dancing and enjoying themselves in the drawing room. How will I endure it here for another whole week?&#x201d;</p><p>He wished he could pluck some stars from the sky and lay them at her feet. He wished that the music would continue for a week so that he could dance with her and kiss her and help see her to the end of the boredom of an unwelcome visit to the country.</p><p>&#x201c;I will be here too,&#x201d; he said with a shrug,</p><p>She looked up at him eagerly&#x2014;the top of her head reached barely to his shoulder. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I shall steal away and spend time with you, Robert. It will be fun and my maid is very easy to escape. She is lazy, but I never complain to Papa because sometimes it is an advantage to have a lazy maid.&#x201d; She laughed her light infectious laugh. &#x201c;You are very handsome. Will you take me to the ruins tomorrow? We went there two days ago, but the marchioness would not let me explore them lest I hurt myself. All I could do was look and listen to your father tell the history of the old castle.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I will take you,&#x201d; he said. But he noted the fact that she had spoken of stealing away<i> </i>to be with him. And of course she was right. It was not at all the thing for the two of them even to have met. They certainly should never have talked or danced. Or kissed. There would be all hell to pay if he were caught taking her to the ruins. He should explain that to her more clearly. But he was seventeen years old, and the realities of life were new to him. He still thought it possible to fight against them, or at least to ignore them.</p><p>&#x201c;Will you?&#x201d; she asked eagerly, clasping her hands to her slender, budding bosom. &#x201c;After luncheon? I shall go to my room for a rest, as the marchioness is always urging me to do. Where shall I meet you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The other side of the stables,&#x201d; he said, pointing. &#x201c;It is almost a mile to the ruins. Will you be able to walk that far?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course I can walk there,&#x201d; she said scornfully. &#x201c;And climb. I want to climb up the tower.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It is dangerous,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Some of the stairs have crumbled away.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But you have climbed it, have you not?&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then I shall climb it too,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Is there a good view from the top?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You can see to the village and beyond,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>The music was playing a quadrille in the drawing room.</p><p>&#x201c;Tomorrow,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;After luncheon. At last there will be a day to look forward to. Good night, Robert.&#x201d;</p><p>She held out one slim hand to him. He took it and realized in some confusion that she meant him to kiss it. He raised it to his lips and felt foolish and flattered and wonderful.</p><p>&#x201c;Good night, Miss Morisette,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>She laughed up at him. &#x201c;You are a courtier after all,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You have just made me feel at least eighteen years old. It is Jeanne, Robert. Jeanne the French way and Robert the English way.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good night, Jeanne,&#x201d; he said, and he was glad of the darkness, which hid his blushes.</p><p>She turned and tripped lightly over the cobbles of the terrace and around to the side of the house. She had, he realized, come out through the servants&#x2019; entrance and was returning the same way. He wondered if she had come out merely for the fresh air or if she had seen him from an upstairs window. The window of her bedchamber overlooked the terrace and the fountain.</p><p>He liked to believe that it was his presence out there that had drawn her. She had called him tall. She had not commented on his thinness, only on his height. And she had called the blondness of his hair lovely and had approved of the fact that he liked to wear it overlong. She had called hi...</p></p><h2>The Weight of a Piano: A novel</h2><p>In 1962, in the Soviet Union, eight-year-old Katya is bequeathed what will become the love of her life: a Bl�thner piano, on which she discovers an enrichening passion for music.

One man alone knew how to choose them. <br><br> Once the leaves had fallen and snow blanketed the ground, Julius Bl�thner made the trip from Leipzig by train and walked through the forest alone. Because of the elevation and the brutal cold, trees there grew very slowly. They stood straight and thick against the elements, their grain dense with rosin. Bl�thner nodded to the young trees as he passed, occasion�ally brushing their bark in greeting. He sought the older ones, whose branches he couldn&#x2019;t reach, whose diameters were so great he couldn&#x2019;t see if a bear were standing behind the trunk. He knocked them with his walking stick, and pressed his ear against them as his intuition dictated, listening for the music hidden inside. He heard it more clearly than any other piano maker, better even than Ignaz B�sendorfer and Carl Bechstein and Henry Steinway. When he found what he was listening for, he marked the tree with a scrap of red wool, which stood out bright against the snow.<br><br> Then the lumberjacks he&#x2019;d hired cut down the trees he&#x2019;d chosen. Watching closely, Bl�thner could tell which were the finest specimens by how they fell. Only those with a mini�mum of seven annular rings per centimeter, all evenly spaced, would be carried out of the forest on sleds, then shipped back to Germany. And the finest among these would become the soundboards that beat like hearts inside his famous pianos.<br><br> As protection against splitting, the logs were kept wet until they reached the sawmill. There they were quarter-sawn to unlock the purest tones, then sawn and planed into uniform planks. The wood chips went into the furnaces to heat the mill and power the steam engines. Because of knots and other imperfections revealed in the cutting, many of the precious tonewood planks also ended up in the furnaces. What was kept was nearly perfect: white in color; light and flexible; the faint traces of the rings densely spaced and running parallel across the faces of the soundboard planks. These raw boards were stored for at least two years, covered and uncovered until their humidity dwindled to about fourteen percent.<br><br> When it was ready, the wood was transported by horse cart to the enormous Bl�thner factory in the western quarter of Leipzig and laid out on racks near the ceiling in hot rooms for many months. But even then it wasn&#x2019;t ready to become an instrument. To ensure that the soundboard would someday conduct Bl�thner&#x2019;s peerless golden tone, the wood had to dry out for another few years in the open air.<br><br> It was with reverence, then, in 1905, that an assistant Kla�vierbaumeister selected a number of those carefully seasoned planks and glued them edge to edge to form a single board. He cut it to the proper shape and planed it to the proper thick�ness, flexible enough to vibrate but strong enough to push back against the pressure of more than two hundred strings. Once crafted, it was returned to those warmer rooms to dry further before thin ribs could be applied to its underside, per�pendicular to the grain lines. Then the soundboard took on a small amount of moisture, enough to allow its top to swell into a gentle curve, upon which the bass and treble bridges would sit, their downward pressure meeting the apex of the opposing curve as if around a great barrel. The Klavierbau�meister admired his work: the impeccably matched parallels of the grain, the precise curvature of the crown. This particular soundboard would provide the heart for the factory&#x2019;s 66,825th piano.<br><br> The frame of the case was built by other craftsmen, its five back posts sturdy enough to bear the weight of the sound�board and the iron plate. The pinblock was cut and fitted. The agraffes were seated into the plate at a height that would determine the speaking length of the strings, which were then strung; tuning pins were hammered in, and the action set and fitted. Cold-pressed felt was layered thick onto the wooden hammers, thinning appropriately toward the delicate treble side. Dampers were installed next, along with the trapwork of pedals and levers, dowels and springs. The case was ebonized after the guts were in, requiring countless coats. The finishers&#x2019; arm muscles bulged above their rolled-up shirtsleeves.<br><br> Next the instrument, nearly complete, was tuned, the ten�sion of each of the 220 strings adjusted to the correct pitch. Then it was regulated, the touch and responsiveness of the action attended to until the motion of the fingers on the keys would be properly transferred to the hammers that struck the strings.<br><br> At last, after many years of effort by many expert hands, the piano was delivered to its final station for voicing. The Meister there lifted the linen blanket covering it and passed a hand over the shiny black top. Why should this piano be special? Each one was special, with its own soul and distinct personal�ity. This one was substantial but unassuming, mysterious but sincere. He let the linen drop onto the factory floor.<br><br> &#x201c;What will you say to this world?&#x201d; he asked the instrument.<br><br> He shaped the hammers one by one, listening to every string, shaving and minutely aerating the felt again and again. He was like a diagnostician, knocking the nerves below a patient&#x2019;s kneecap, measuring the response. The piano called out each time in compliant reply. Hello, hello.<br><br> &#x201c;Fertig,&#x201d; he said when the work was done. He wiped the sweat off his forehead with his sleeve, pushed the wisps of white hair away from his face. Standing back from the piano, he regarded this complete and brand-new entity that would be&#x2014;after being played in properly&#x2014;capable of incredible feats. The first few years were unpredictable, but over time it would open up and gather into itself a unique history. For now it was a perfect instrument, characterized only by its potential.<br><br> The Meister fluffed his apron as he sat down on the barrel he&#x2019;d borrowed for a seat and, flexing his fingers, considered which piece to christen the piano with. Schubert, his favorite composer. He would play the rondo of his penultimate sonata, the big A Major; the opening melody was pretty, with a feeling of hopefulness and joy that preceded its more pensive, agi�tated development. This would be the perfect inauguration of the glistening black Bl�thner No. 66,825.<br><br> &#x201c;Listen!&#x201d; he called out, but nobody could hear him above the factory&#x2019;s ambient noise. &#x201c;Here she is born!&#x201d;<br><br> And he pressed his finger down on C-sharp, the first note of the rondo, listening hard, and it rang out to meet him with the innocence and power of a child&#x2019;s first cry. Finding it as pure as he&#x2019;d hoped, he began to play the rest of the sonata. He would send off this shining new piano with as much optimism as he could gather, knowing it would no longer be as vestal once it was touched by its future owners&#x2019; desperately human hands.<br><b>Chapter Two</b><br><br>Clara Lundy kicked a step stool against the front tire of an old 1996 Chevrolet Blazer and leaned over the engine, tossing her dark blond ponytail over her shoulder. She unscrewed the cap of the relief fitting and put a shop towel over it to catch the gas that leaked out when she pressed the valve. When the lines were bled, she stuffed the towel into her back pocket and went to her toolbox to grab the 16mm and 19mm wrenches and the quick-disconnect tool. Then, with an athletic jump, she disappeared into the yellow-framed pit so she could work from underneath. She removed the bracket, released the snap-lock fitting, and pulled the rubber hose off the outlet side of the filter first to keep the fuel from dripping in her eyes. She&#x2019;d learned that lesson long ago in her uncle&#x2019;s garage and had never forgotten it. <br><br> &#x201c;Hey, Clara?&#x201d; Peter Kappas, one of the shop owners&#x2019; three sons, peered down at her. A halo of late afternoon sunlight out�lined his bulky silhouette. &#x201c;That guy with the rack-and-pinion job&#x2019;s back again. He says it&#x2019;s still making noise.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Same noise or new?&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Popping. Bolts, probably.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Can you do it? I&#x2019;m not done with this filter.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I promised the Corvette would be done by five.&#x201d;<br><br> Clara slipped the new filter into the bracket. &#x201c;Okay, give me fifteen. I&#x2019;ll get it up in the air and see what&#x2019;s going on. But if it&#x2019;s the mounting bolts, then you&#x2019;ll have to do the alignment again. You got time?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;For you?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Stop.&#x201d;<br><br> He raised his arms. &#x201c;Kidding. Yeah, I can do it.&#x201d;<br><br> After she tightened all the bolts and checked the lines, she went back up to prime the system. She turned the key to On, waited for the fuel pump to kick on and off, then switched the key to Off. She did that a few more times, and sitting there, she glimpsed herself in the rearview mirror and was startled to see that she looked older than her twenty-six years, like she&#x2019;d aged a decade overnight. Her eyelids, in spite of the little bit of makeup she&#x2019;d put on, were still vaguely puffy from her cry�ing jag the night before. Her mouth was set so hard that tiny lines radiated from her lips; she&#x2019;d been clenching her teeth. When she relaxed her jaw, her pale cheeks seemed to sag and her mouth turned down at the corners. There was a smudge of grease across her forehead&#x2014;probably from having pushed her bangs out of her eyes&#x2014;that resembled her late father&#x2019;s birthmark. She looked at herself, at his light brown eyes and pale eyelashes, their matching high cheekbones, and felt a gut punch at this unanticipated image of his face in the mirror. An old grief added to the new.<br><br> She turned the key all the way, and the Blazer&#x2019;s engine fired up perfectly.<br><br> &#x201c;Clara! Phone for you!&#x201d; someone called above the noises in the shop: the hydraulic torque wrench and the air com�pressor, the glide and slam of toolkit drawers, the relentless clinking of metal, the ever-present <i>la�ko</i> music coming from a grease-covered boom box in the corner, the shouts in Greek and English.<br><br> She wiped the stain from her forehead with the dirty towel as she walked over to the phone that hung on the wall. Peter&#x2019;s brother Teddy stopped her with a hand on her forearm.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Ryan,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You might want to take it in the office.&#x201d; Who knew what they&#x2019;d been saying about her and Ryan. Peter&#x2019;s mother, Anna, could read her face as though Clara were her own daughter and turn an opinion&#x2014;<i>I don&#x2019;t think this Ryan is good for you</i>&#x2014;into a topic for general discussion. Clara usu�ally found herself offering supporting information without even meaning to, and the entire Kappas family soon knew all her personal business. She didn&#x2019;t mind, though; they were the closest thing to a real family she&#x2019;d had in a long time.<br><br> Clara nodded. The office was little more than a desk against the wall in the waiting area, between the water cooler and the coffeemaker. It was hardly private, but there weren&#x2019;t any cus�tomers inside at the moment, and Anna, who was behind the counter writing an order for parts, winked at her and said, in her thick accent, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give you a minute.&#x201d;<br><br> Clara sat down and tried not to look at the flashing caller-on-hold light on the phone. She gazed instead at the framed photos on the wall of the Sporades Islands: the family&#x2019;s white�washed villa, the curved rock beach, the impossible turquoise water.<br><br> When she could avoid it no longer, she took a deep breath and picked up the line. &#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; she said.<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not answering your cell.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m working.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Whatever, Clara. Listen, I&#x2019;m taking off for a few days so you can pack up your stuff. I really want you to be out by the weekend, okay?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Wait, what? Seriously? I thought we were still talking about everything.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Clara, did you not hear me last night? I&#x2019;m tired of waiting for you to make up your mind. You just don&#x2019;t want what I do.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I never said I didn&#x2019;t want the same thing, I just asked for time.&#x201d; She turned her body toward the wall. &#x201c;Ryan, please.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I know you needed time, and I&#x2019;ve tried to give it to you. But I can&#x2019;t keep putting your needs ahead of mine. I&#x2019;m ready to move forward. I want a family. I&#x2019;d like it to be with you, but if it can&#x2019;t be . . . well, what choice do I have?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Look, I love you, Ryan, you know I do. But marriage is a big step. Why can&#x2019;t we just be together? Why&#x2019;s everything such a rush?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What is it about making this permanent that freaks you out so much? I know you love me. Why can&#x2019;t you just say yes?&#x201d;<br><br> Clara sighed. She could change this conversation, change her entire life, with just one word. But she couldn&#x2019;t do it. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Then we&#x2019;re done. I need you out. I need to move on.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;So you&#x2019;re really going to kick me out? After two years you&#x2019;re giving me, what, four days to move? How do you expect me to do that? And where am I supposed to get the money for it?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You know I wouldn&#x2019;t leave you on the street. I found you an apartment in East Bakersfield. I already put down the first and last months&#x2019; rent. I figured this would make things easier.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Jesus, Ryan. Couldn&#x2019;t we have talked about it first? <i>East Bakersfield?</i>&#x201d;<br><br> He made a huffing sound. &#x201c;Do you really care where you live? It seems like all you really care about is that damn garage.&#x201d;<br><br> She balled the spiral phone cord into her fist, fighting the urge to cry again. Was she crying over losing him? Losing her home? Her own indecision?<br><br> &#x201c;The lease and key are on the kitchen table,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;When you&#x2019;re out, you can drop your old key through the slot.&#x201d;<br><br> Clara rested her forehead against the wall and exhaled. &#x201c;So that&#x2019;s it?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yeah, that&#x2019;s it.&#x201d;<br><br> He paused, they both did, and she wondered if he&#x2019;d say what he always did at the end of a phone call. <i>You&#x2019;re my girl&#x2014;you know that, right?</i> She couldn&#x2019;t speak. She couldn&#x2019;t let go. She leaned forward in anticipation, waiting, yearning, yet reluctant to give in.<br><br> &#x201c;Good luck, Clara. I hope you figure out whatever it is you want, I really do. I&#x2019;m just sorry it wasn&#x2019;t me.&#x201d; Then he hung up.<br><br> She held the phone against her ear, listening to her heart�beat until the busy signal began beeping. When she turned around, Peter was standing at the door.<br><br> &#x201c;You okay?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br> She didn&#x2019;t answer right away. Maybe she hadn&#x2019;t really loved Ryan after all, certainly not how he wanted her to. But she was used to being with him, to having someone to go home to, and life with him had been easy. &#x201c;Will you help me move?&#x201d; she asked Peter.<br><br> He pulled off his ball cap&#x2014;<i>Havoline, Protect What Matters</i>&#x2014;and raked his fingers through his thick black hair. &#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; he said, and put the cap back on. &#x201c;You know I will.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Matchmaker&#39;s List</h2><p><b><b>One devoted modern girl + a meddlesome, traditional grandmother = a heartwarming multicultural romantic comedy about finding love where you least expect it</b>.</b><br><br>Raina Anand may have finally given in to family pressure and agreed to let her grandmother play matchmaker, but that doesn't mean she has to like it--or that she has to play by the rules.

Her nose twitching, she looked me up and down as I forced myself up the steps.</p><p>&#x201c;Is that what you&#x2019;re wearing?&#x201d;</p><p>I shrugged and glanced down at my weekend jeans, my favorite checked shirt. It&#x2019;s what I always wore home during one of my weekly visits, but I supposed today wasn&#x2019;t an ordinary day.</p><p>I was twenty-nine today, and walking into an ambush.</p><p>&#x201c;I was hoping you would dress up, nah? We have guest.&#x201d;</p><p>A guest. A guest implied a cup of chai and a tray of sweets quickly defrosted from the Deepfreeze. A guest was small talk, compliments, gossip.</p><p>A guest was not an unannounced blind date chaperoned by your grandmother.</p><p>&#x201c;What kind of guest?&#x201d; I asked evenly, deciding not tell her that my best friend, Shay, had already warned me about the blind date. Nani didn&#x2019;t answer the question, clucking her tongue as I bent over and brushed a kiss on the top of her head. She smelled the way she always smelled, like cocoa butter and roasted cumin. A touch of garlic. She stepped back and continued her evaluation, her tiny fingers pinching at the fleshy part of her chin as I kicked off my shoes.</p><p>&#x201c;Find something more suitable.&#x201d; She flicked her hand up the staircase, and I bounded up the stairs to the second floor, knowing full well there was nothing nicer in my old room. Too-large T-shirts from summer camps and music festivals where my favorite band that year had headlined. Jogging pants, the type with black or white snaps running up the leg. My old trumpet.</p><p>It was odd how little of me I kept here. But of all the places I&#x2019;d lived since moving out&#x2014;a dumpy apartment with Shay; a shared flat in London; and now, a new condo with my name on the mortgage&#x2014;it was this house that I&#x2019;d always considered home. I heard Nani calling, her voice staccato and sweet, and I ran a brush through my hair and then made my way back downstairs.</p><p>She looked up at me expectantly. &#x201c;Nothing?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All my clothes are downtown.&#x201d;</p><p>She arched her brows. &#x201c;Anything in guest room?&#x201d;</p><p>Again, I shook my head. Mom&#x2019;s old room. Starch white walls and a beige linen duvet, not a trace of her left in the closet. Nani sighed as I reached the bottom step, evaluating my outfit one last time. And then she shrugged, squeezed my hand, and said, &#x201c;Still my pretty girl. Even in that.&#x201d;</p><p>Anywhere Nani lived would always be home.</p><p>I tucked in my shirt and followed her through the kitchen, ducking my head beneath the crossbeam as we took the eight steps down to the lower level. To the &#x201c;entertaining room,&#x201d; as Nani called it: orange corduroy couches wrapped stiffly in plastic; the walls packed with street art bought for a few hundred lire on my grandparents&#x2019; one trip abroad; Lord Ganesh presiding on the mantel, a choir of porcelain Siamese cats chiming in unison. And our guest stood at the room&#x2019;s rapturous center, awkwardly in place, his dark brown skin the same shade as the varnish on the wood paneling.</p><p>&#x201c;Raina,&#x201d; said Nani, clutching my wrist. &#x201c;Meet Sachin.&#x201d; She dragged me closer until the top of his forehead was square to my mouth, and I tried to ignore the dull sensation in my belly. He looked vaguely familiar. Perhaps someone I&#x2019;d known as a child, or seen in the stack of pictures Nani had started leaving on the kitchen table. He was quite short, albeit symmetrical&#x2014;handsome even. He smiled and brought his palms together at his chest, bowing slightly to both of us.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello, Raina,&#x201d; he said, like my name was a word he&#x2019;d invented.</p><p>&#x201c;Hi.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sachin drove far to come for your birthday lunch.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s your birthday?&#x201d; His face stiffened. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean to intrude.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No intrusion, dear.&#x201d; She pinched his cheek. &#x201c;My Raina and I are so happy you joined. Nah, Raina?&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>&#x201c;Raina is such a good girl. Always coming home from her busy job to take care of her nani.&#x201d; She gasped and turned to me. &#x201c;Sachin is a busy man, too. Raina, did you know he is doctor?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, I didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; I turned to him. &#x201c;My best friend is a doc&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a cardiologist, actually.&#x201d; He glanced away. &#x201c;To be more precise.&#x201d;</p><p>I clamped down on my lower lip. Precise, or just plain arrogant?</p><p>&#x201c;Subspecialized at Columbia,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Mhm.&#x201d; I tried not to roll my eyes. &#x201c;Is that right?&#x201d;</p><p>He nodded, fingering his wristwatch. &#x201c;Diverse city. Beautiful campus. One of the top programs in the country&#x2014;world, even. Some might say.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think I&#x2019;ve heard of Columbia.&#x201d; I folded my arms across my chest. &#x201c;Is that in Cleveland?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Actually, New York&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you&#x2019;re the kind of doctor that cleans teeth, right?&#x201d;</p><p>Nani jabbed me on the arm, and I tried not to laugh.</p><p>&#x201c;No, no. It&#x2019;s&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Cardio-logist. Oh! You&#x2019;re a sports doctor.&#x201d;</p><p>He shifted from side to side. &#x201c;Actually, cardiac electrophysiology is a&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Nani clucked her tongue, waving him off. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t listen to her. She&#x2019;s a silly one, my Raina.&#x201d; She wrapped her arms around my waist as if she were a coconspirator in the charade.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; said Sachin.</p><p>Evidently, they didn&#x2019;t teach sarcasm at Columbia.</p><p>&#x201c;Dear,&#x201d; Nani said, turning to Sachin. &#x201c;Would you like chai before lunch?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Chai sounds lovely, Auntie.&#x201d;</p><p>She waddled up the stairs, leaving me alone with him, and I sat down on one of the couches, the plastic screeching beneath me as I settled onto the cushion. Sachin joined me a moment later, his legs spread so wide he was nearly touching me. To my dismay, he actually smelled pretty good: the way rich men tended to smell, like Dev used to smell. An understated potency that still dominated the entire room.</p><p>&#x201c;Your nani is very sweet,&#x201d; he said after a moment.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s the best.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s her name again?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Belinda.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d;</p><p>I looked straight ahead, deadpan, trying not to look at him out of the corner of my eye.</p><p>&#x201c;Is that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Bengali?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I sighed. &#x201c;Her name is Suvali.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But, you just said&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It was a joke.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A joke, right&#x201d;&#x2014;he let out a stiff laugh&#x2014;&#x201c;good one.&#x201d;</p><p>Growing up, everyone just referred to family friends as auntie or uncle, but I still felt mildly offended on Nani&#x2019;s behalf that he didn&#x2019;t even know her name. I reclined slightly on the couch, and stared straight ahead. Lord Ganesh&#x2014;eyes, trunk, and all&#x2014;stared right back.</p><p>Upstairs, I could hear Nani bustling around in the kitchen. She would be setting out her favorite teacups on the silver tray Nana had bought her as wedding present, placing teaspoons equally spaced along the paper napkins&#x2014;garish, a bold red and gold&#x2014;that she&#x2019;d once bought in bulk at a discount store going out of business. Fifty packages for a five-dollar bill.</p><p>&#x201c;Raina, hey, listen,&#x201d; Sachin said after a while.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;</p><p>He played with his rounded fingernails, picking beneath them. &#x201c;I really hate to ruin your birthday, but&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You have to go?&#x201d; I asked, a little too eagerly.</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; He flashed me a smile, two rows of square white teeth. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry. I&#x2019;ll stay for lunch. But I would hate to mislead you on my intentions.&#x201d; He looked up at me quickly, and then back at the floor. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not interested.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s fi&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You seem like a really nice girl, Raina. Really nice. And I don&#x2019;t mean to hurt you.&#x201d; He sighed again. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just not in that place, you know? I&#x2019;m not ready for the kind of commitment that our families&#x2014;that you&#x2014;seem to be after.&#x201d;</p><p>I bit my tongue. The only thing I was after was for him to leave.</p><p>&#x201c;I know, I know.&#x201d; He stood up and paced in front me, his hands partially shoved into his pockets. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a doctor, I get it. The biology of it all just isn&#x2019;t fair. It&#x2019;s harder for women. More pressure after they&#x2014;uh&#x2014;reach a certain age?&#x201d;</p><p>I let out a deep, writhing sigh. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s so hard.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And your nani finding you a single doctor is&#x2014;&#x201d;&nbsp;He paused and looked me dead in the eye. &#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s the dream, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;</p><p>A dream? More like a nightmare.</p><p>&#x201c;But really, Raina, you seem like a nice girl.&#x201d; He knelt down in front of me and petted my knee. &#x201c;Really nice. And I&#x2019;m sure you will find someone&#x2014;soon.&#x201d;</p><p>I resisted the urge to tell him what I really thought of him, and studied him as he crouched at my feet. Sachin was the definition of the man Shay and I had spent so many years avoiding: the Westernized Indian. The one who used to be captain of the chess club or math team, and although brutalized for it in high school, now threw out the stereotypes about his culture as an anecdote to make the C-cups and hair extensions laugh as he chivalrously paid for their drinks. He was the archetype who watched sports and drank beer, had the uncanny ability to mock his father&#x2019;s accent, yet would still want his wife to learn how to make curry the way his mother did. He was the hybrid of east and west; the immigrant mentality distilled and harnessed, his arrogance the forgivable by-product of ambition.</p><p>Sachin looked up at me and heaved out a patronizing sigh. &#x201c;Are you going to be okay?&#x201d;</p><p>He was also the type of man that any nani would want her granddaughter to marry, and as I patted his shoulder reassuringly, I tried to convince myself that Sachin&#x2014;that his type&#x2014;wasn&#x2019;t what I was interested in, either.</p><p>There seems to be a great deal of misinformation around the modern-day arranged marriage. I am often bombarded with questions by coworkers or middle-aged women sitting next to me on long-haul flights after they&#x2019;ve picked up on the fact that I&#x2019;m half Indian. After explaining to them that I was raised by the Indian side of my family, and that whichever white guy fathered me was never in the picture, they smile and tell me that being Indian is all the rage these days. And in an exertion of worldliness, I am cited anecdotes they&#x2019;ve picked up in the frozen food section at Costco while buying paneer, or watching twenty minutes of Dil Chata Hai on the Bollywood channel that comes with their deluxe cable packages. They love the bright colors and gold chains. The eccentric music. The food&#x2014;oh, how they love the food. And of course, they are curious about my love life. They want to know more about this whole &#x201c;arranged marriage&#x201d; thing, whether soon I, too, might be enlisted.</p><p>But the protocol of today&#x2019;s arranged marriage in my community is less glamorous than they might anticipate. It is choosing from a roster of carefully vetted men, men whose family, religion, background, values, and sometimes even astrology match your own. It is having parents who want their children to marry into the &#x201c;culture,&#x201d; and so they hurl them against a brick wall of blind dates until one finally sticks. It is arranged dating, really; an agreement to decide quickly whether you are in love.</p><p>I grew up with dozens of girls who went this route; women fast-tracked down the aisle, business class on a nonstop flight toward happily ever after.</p><p>And they seemed happy.</p><p>After all, they tell me&#x2014;their mouths full of champagne and vanilla cream cake, cocooned in flowing bridal lenghas worth as much as a new car&#x2014;what was the big deal about being set up by your family? Isn&#x2019;t &#x201c;today&#x2019;s arranged marriage&#x201d; equivalent to being set up by a friend, or an algorithm in your go-to dating app? Aren&#x2019;t their chances of having a successful marriage as high as the girl who ends up marrying her one-night stand? Or the one who met her leading man in college? I am one of the very few in my generation still unmarried in my hometown, and I never know what to say. How much to smile. And so I help myself to another drink&#x2014;sometimes, another piece of cake&#x2014;and reverently congratulate them on their Bollywood ending.</p><p>But I always wonder what happens after the ceremonial fire goes out and the guests go home, stuffed and slightly drunk on Johnnie Walker. Nani&#x2019;s marriage was arranged, and unlike today&#x2019;s blessed nuptials, she didn&#x2019;t have much of a say in the matter. Her father showed her a black-and-white photo of a lanky boy with round wire spectacles, and later, someone smeared red powder on her forehead, and just like that&#x2014;well, nearly&#x2014;she was married. It was simple. Clear-cut. A transaction performed not out of love for a would-be spouse, but for one&#x2019;s own family.</p><p>But wasn&#x2019;t an arranged marriage beneath me? I wasn&#x2019;t really Indian, after all. I was Canadian. A girl who refused to feel out of place in her mostly white, middle-class suburb in west Toronto. I had Rollerbladed and held lemonade stands, rolled my eyes on &#x201c;Culture Day&#x201d; at school when Shay and I were forced to wear lenghas, the other kids crowding around us for a chance to paw at the fake crystals sewn onto the sleeves. I only saw other Indians when I was dragged to dinner parties, and at temple every Sunday. When we went bulk grocery shopping in Scarborough because the corner Safeway didn&#x2019;t have the right brand of lentils or coconut milk. And even though Ravi Shankar always seemed to be playing on the radio at home, and my clothes perpetually reeked of masala, I grew up fully committed to my role in what otherwise seemed to be a white narrative. I played a girl who couldn&#x2019;t believe in arranged marriage&#x2014;not only because of the clich� of her own family shambles, but because the cynicism of her Western world, the literary fiction on her bookshelf, barely allowed her to believe in marriage at all.</p><p>So I resisted. I resisted the idea of a planned union that might make me happy. That might make Nani happy.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you like Sachin?&#x201d; she asked after he had left. She stood beside me as I washed the dishes, the side of her head lightly resting on my shoulder.</p><p>Did I like him? I didn&#x2019;t dislike him. After he told me he just wasn&#x2019;t interested, and Nani came back with the tea, the pressure had evaporated. It wasn&#x2019;t a chaperoned date, a three-hour festival I&#x2019;d have to immortalize in the diary I&#x2019;d outgrown so I could one day tell my daughters about all the silly things their father said the first time our eyes locked.</p><p>It was just lunch.</p><p>&#x201c;Will you see him again?&#x201d; Nani asked.</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; I shook my head. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t think so?&#x201d;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t answer, and she leaned forward on her tiptoes and turned off the tap.</p><p>&#x201c;You got along with him, nah?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; I turned to face her, not quite sure how to tell her I&#x2019;d already been rejected. &#x201c;What did you think of him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Only you know what you need in husband, Raina. What you need to be happy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am happy.&#x201d;</p><p>She wiped a fleck of foam off my neck and stared at me, attempting to read my expression the way she attempted to read English.</p><p>&#x201c;I am!&#x201d;</p><p>She grimaced and glanced away, as if she&#x2019;d heard it, too. The urgency. The insistence. I attacked the rice cooker, knuckles and steel wool, my palms burning red in the hot water. The suds washed off, and I held it up, set it sideways on the dish rack. Why did I sound like I was trying to convince myself? I was happy, wasn&#x2019;t I? I had everything, less the one thing that, to Nani, defined the rest. The boxes for college and career had been ticked; only marriage remained.</p><p>She rolled up her sleeves and handed me a frying pan. Staring at it, she said, &#x201c;You agreed to this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know. But I said thirty.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re twenty-nine now, Raina. What difference is one year?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, what is the differen...</p></p><h2>Aladdin and Other Tales from the Arabian Nights: Illustrated by W. Heath Robinson (Everyman&#39;s Library Children&#39;s Classics Series)</h2><p>For the past two hundred years, Western readers, young and old alike, have been transported to the fabulous Orient by means of these remarkable stories, in which the everyday mingles on an equal footing with the uncanny and the miraculous. Accompanying the text are illustrations by W. Heath Robinson, which are themselves miracles of visual and imaginative sympathy.</p><p><b>William Heath Robinson (1872-1944)</b> was the youngest of the three artist sons of a wood engraver. Born in Hornsey Rise, north London, he studied at Islington School of Art and briefly at the Royal Academy Schools. His grandfather, Thomas Robinson, had been a bookbinder working in Newcastle for the famous wood engraver, Thomas Bewick, and subsequently took up engraving and illustrating himself. It is not surprising, therefore, that all three brothers &#x2013; Thomas, Charles and William &#x2013; became book and magazine illustrators. William was still in his twenties when he was commissioned, with other young artists &#x2013; Helen Stratton, A.D. McCormick, A. L. Davis and A. E. Norbury &#x2013; to illustrate a collection of stories from <b>The Arabian Nights</b>, published in 1899. William's contribution was by far the largest and the best, demonstrating the beauty of line and composition that characterized his illustrations for other literary classics. But now he is chiefly remembered for his humorous drawings and the weird contraptions that gave his name to the English language for any mechanical device 'absurdly complicated in design and having a simple function'. At the Memorial Exhibition after his death, one of his few peers in comic drawing, Nicolas Bentley, compared him to Leonardo da Vinci, claiming that Heath Robinson 'had the advantage of Leonardo, in that some of his inventions did at least <i>look</i> as if they might have worked'.</p><h2>Bronx Primitive: Portraits in a Childhood</h2><p>"As an account of growing up female, it is a fit companion piece to Mary McCarthy's classic <i>Memoirs of a Catholic Girlhood</i>."&#x2014;Le Anne Schreiber, <i>The New York Times</i>.</p><p>Splendid as ever, Kate Simon now turns her powers of observation upon herself as a child and upon the sidewalks, the stoops, the public schools and the railroad flats of the Bronx she grew up in. If the words "incomparable" and "unrivalled" have not been included in this context, it's because her history is mined from a vein which has been so much exploited in our literature that comparisons are inevitable. -- <i>The New York Times Book Review, Helen Yglesias</i>Simon's 1982 memoir made several best books lists. It follows her own life as an immigrant child growing into adolescence in the Bronx. This remains for "general readers and mature YAs" (LJ 5/1/82).<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A User&#39;s Guide to Sida acuta, Sida cordifolia, and Sida rhombifolia:: How to Grow, Harvest, and Make Medicinals from the World&#39;s Best Herbal ... Superior Fiber, Grow Them with Your Tomatoes</h2><p><p><b> The Many Healing Powers of Sida </b> </p> <p> This book is written to be an easy read that tells you how to grow Sidas, how to harvest them, and how to make simple medicinals from them. My growing experience is with Sida acuta, but the growing conditions and requirements for Sida cordifolia and Sida rhombifolia are quite similar. </p> This small book is based upon a much larger, seminal book I have published <p> Here&#x2019;s how simple it can be. Even apartment dwellers with a porch, or any space at all, can grow a bunch of Sidas in a planter, harvest the plant, drown it for a few months in some vodka, and have some potent medicine for when they really need it. </p> <p> Sidas are not the only solution to our health problems, but they are absolutely the best (and easiest) first step you can make for home-based health. Sidas can protect you against many (if not most) disabling conditions and diseases. Hundreds of millions of people over thousands of years can&#x2019;t be all that wrong. If you already take herbs this will go right to the front of your herb cabinet. </p> <p> This small book is based on a larger reference book I wrote on the genus Sida: Sida acuta, Sida cordifolia, Sida rhombifolia, Etc.: Everything Science and Tradition Knows About the World&#x2019;s Best Herbal Antibiotics, Used by Millions of People Every Day, Top Ayurvedic Herbs, Protein-Rich Survival Plants, Superior Fiber, Grow Them with Your Tomatoes </p> <p> This &#x201c;big book&#x201d; comprises all of the peer-review research on Sidas from around the world, as well as traditional uses for a wide array of health benefits, including Ayurvedic medicine. It is fully referenced. </p> <p> <b> Sida Is A Powerful Herbal Antibiotic, Antifungal, etc. </b> </p> <ul><li><p>Sidas are consumed by millions of people every day all over the world for their health, and people have been healing themselves with Sidas for thousands of years. </p></li> <li><p>Sidas control or kill 27 pathogenic bacteria, including many resistant strains, including MRSA. </p></li> <li><p>Sidas have shown excellent effect against malaria and other parasites. </p></li> <li><p>Sidas have tested well against 16 different pathogenic fungi, including 15 strains of candida. </p></li> <li><p>Sidas protect your liver, kidney &amp; brain (and more). They are blood cleansing and help to balance your fats/lipids. They are adaptogenic, tonic, aphrodisiac, beneficial to digestion, and much more. This book lists 160 ways that Sida can benefit you! </p></li> <li><p>At least 10 Sidas are top Ayurvedic herbs, including the famous Bala. Several Sidas are Rasayana rejuvenating tonics as well. </p></li> <li><p>Sidas are outstanding fiber crops -they compare to jute. Great brooms.</p></li> <li><p>Sida acuta can be grown in temperate climates as an annual. I grow it in Zone 8 outdoors. If you can grow tomatoes, you can probably grow Sida. </p></li> </ul> <p> Why have you never heard of Sida before? That is a good question. The genus Sida is not in any Western herbals, but is well-known and esteemed in all tropical countries, especially India. Everyone assumed that since it was a tropical plant it was confined to greenhouses. </p> <p> My "great discoveries" are that Sidas can be grown in most temperate climates as an annual, and Sidas are fully medicinal when grown as an annual. This puts the world's most powerful herbal anti-pathogen (antibiotic, anti-fungal, anti-cancer, anti-malarial, etc.) right in your backyard! </p> <p> Sidas are weeds, and as such are very easy to grow. It is easy to make Sida plants into potent medicine, and this pamphlet tells you how. Sidas are non-toxic, do not interfere with pharmaceuticals, and have no significant side-effects. </p> <p> <b> For naturally grown Sida seed, and further information on Sida, go to my website (bbruneau.com). </b> </p></p><p><p>I have been a plant person most of my adult life. My wife and I started Bountiful Gardens Seeds in 1982, which is part of Ecology Action of the Midpeninsula, an organization that has been desperately trying to save the world&#x2019;s soil for the last 45 years while refining a farming method (bio-intensive) that actually creates soil while being very productive. </p> <p>We started Bountiful Gardens because heirloom, open-pollinated seeds were hard to come by in the 1980s, and disappearing. At the time it was not certain that these heirloom seeds would continue to be available to the general public. We offered a considerable number of varieties that otherwise would not have been available. Back then we also had a &#x201c;Healing Herbs Garden Club&#x201d; that really educated me in medicinals of all sorts. BG has always carried a strong section of medicinal plant seed. </p> <p>For years I selected many of the varieties we carried in our catalog, which was not unlike being an Indiana Jones of the plant world. All of this has given me good experience with discovering everything about a plant. It also helps to be married to a biologist who fills in any blanks. I retired as the third longest-tenured employee ever at Ecology Action after our founders. </p> <p>I consider myself a personal herbalist. I do not have the intimate, extensive knowledge of hundreds of herbs that a professional herbalist would know, but rather I know very well the few plants that I need, seeking only my health, and the health of my family. Medicinal herbs and preventative medicine have been at the core of my family&#x2019;s health for at least 50 years. I know the plants I use very well, and when I discover a new one that is as good as Sida is, I am completely on board right away and want to know everything about it. The next step is a thorough and intensive research into its known benefits. So for over a year I intensely scoured the internet for peer-review research on Sida, and in particular studies on Sida acuta, the species that I use. The results have exceeded my wildest expectations. </p> <p>Around 1990 I created a poster, The Vegetable Gardener&#x2019;s Guide (in its third printing), that has been a perennial favorite of master gardeners &#x2013; they are grateful to have all the essential questions beginners ask right there on the wall. </p> <p>In 2004 I decided to put my enthusiasm for the French bidet into a book. I wrote the "bidet bible" of the industry, first book ever in our Library of Congress. </p></p><h2>Cold Vengeance (Agent Pendergast Series, 11)</h2><p><b>Twelve years ago, Special Agent Pendergast's beloved wife was murdered during an African safari -- and now, he's on a quest for revenge.</b><br> Devastated by the discovery that his wife, Helen, was murdered, Special Agent Pendergast must have retribution. But revenge is not simple. As he stalks his wife's betrayers--a chase that takes him from the wild moors of Scotland to the bustling streets of New York City and the darkest bayous of Louisiana--he is also forced to dig further into Helen's past. And he is stunned to learn that Helen may have been a collaborator in her own murder.<br><br>Peeling back the layers of deception, Pendergast realizes that the conspiracy is deeper, goes back generations, and is more monstrous than he could have ever imagined--and everything he's believed, everything he's trusted, everything he's understood . . . may be a horrific lie.</p><p>The thrillers of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child "stand head and shoulders above their rivals" (<em>Publishers Weekly</em>).

However, the bludgeoning of the young and gorgeous Amber Marshalson that follows is clearly murder. In the midst of the hottest summer on record, Inspector Wexford is called in to investigate. He discovers the two cases may be linked, and that Amber was at the scene of Mavis&#x2019;s death. When a third body is found, the case takes a disturbing and unexpected turn.

Then he got back into the driving seat to move the car deep into a cave made by hawthorn bushes and brambles, and the hop vines which climbed over everything in this wood. It was late June and the vegetation very dense and luxuriant.<br><br>Getting out again and standing back to take a good look, he could barely see the car. Probably he only saw it because he knew it was there. No one else would notice it. He squatted down, hoisted the backpack up on to his shoulders and slowly stood up to his full height. The movement reminded him of something and it was a moment before he realised what it was: lifting up his little son to sit on his shoulders. A hundred years ago, it seemed. The backpack was lighter than the boy but felt heavier to him.<br><br>He was afraid that if he stood upright the pack would jerk him backwards and break his spine. Of course it wouldn&#x2019;t. It just felt that way. All the same, he wouldn&#x2019;t stand upright, wouldn&#x2019;t even try it. Instead, he stooped, bending almost double. It wasn&#x2019;t far. He could walk like this the two hundred yards to the bridge. Anyone seeing him from a distance in this half-light would have thought him a humpbacked man.<br><br>There was no one to see. The twisty country lane wound round Yorstone Wood and over the bridge. He could have brought the car right up to the bridge but that way it would have been seen, so he had driven off the lane along a ride and then through a clearing to find the hop-grown cave. In the distance he thought he heard a car, then something heavier with a diesel engine. They would be on the road below, Brimhurst Lane that ran from Myfleet to Brimhurst Prideaux, passing under Yorstone Bridge ahead of him. It wasn&#x2019;t far now but it seemed like miles. If his legs gave way he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to get up again. Would it be easier to drag the backpack? What, then, if he met someone? Dragging something looks much more suspicious than carrying it. He pressed his shoulders back a little and, surprisingly, that was better. There was no one to meet. He could see the lane through the trees and the little stone bridge no one had reinforced with steel or replaced with a brightly painted wooden structure. <br><br>Its parapets were low, too low for safety, according to the local paper. The paper was always on about this bridge, and the dangers of the lane and the low parapets. He walked out on to the bridge, squatted down and let the backpack slip off his shoulders to the ground. He undid the flaps and then the zip. Inside, now revealed, was a lump of concrete, very roughly spherical, a bit bigger than a soccer ball. A pair of gloves was also inside the pack. To be on the safe side, he put them on. Though it would never come to anyone examining his hands, it would be stupid to scrape or bruise them. <br><br>What light remained was fading fast and with the coming of the dark it grew cooler. His watch told him that it was nine fifteen. Not long now. He lifted up the lump of concrete in his gloved hands, thought of balancing it on the parapet in readiness, then thought again. It wasn&#x2019;t beyond the bounds of possibility that someone would come along the path he had used and cross the bridge. Wait for the call, he thought. It won&#x2019;t be long now.<br><br>No traffic had passed along the road below since he had come on to the bridge but a car came now, going towards Brimhurst Prideaux, most probably all the way to Kingsmarkham. He closed his hand over the mobile in his pocket, worried because it hadn&#x2019;t rung. Then it rang.<br><br>&#x2018;Yes?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;She&#x2019;s left. You want the number again?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ve got it. A silver Honda.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Right.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;A silver Honda. Should be along in four minutes.&#x2019;<br><br>He heard the line close. It was dark now. A car passed under the bridge, heading towards Brimhurst St Mary and Myfleet. The road dipped where the bridge passed over it and then twisted to the left, almost a right-angled bend. There were tall trees on the corner with thick ancient trunks and a black and white arrow sign opposite, pointing traffic to the left. A minute had passed.<br><br>He moved across to the other side of the bridge, dragging the backpack behind him, and there he bent down, heaved up the lump of concrete, his arms straining, and set it on the parapet. Just as well it wasn&#x2019;t far to lift it. Another minute gone. A white van with headlights on at full beam came from the Myfleet direction, a car following it, to pass, just behind him, a motorbike coming from Kingsmarkham. He was momentarily blinded by the headlights, held in them, which made him curse. No one should see him. The silver Honda with the number he had memorised would be along soon, very soon. The third minute passed. A fourth.<br><br>He hated anticlimaxes. The silver Honda could have taken another route. It was all very well to say it never did but you could never say that, not when it came to the way people behaved. He was facing the way it would come, towards Myfleet. It would pass under the bridge but before it reached the left-hand bend . . . He could see lights in the distance. The lights appeared and disappeared as a hedge or a tree trunk cut them from his view, and appeared again. Two sets of lights, not one car but two, both of them silver, quite close together. One was the Honda but he couldn&#x2019;t tell which, not from here, not in the dark, but he could read the number or the last three digits. <br><br>As soon as he had given a great push to the lump on the parapet and felt it drop, he knew he had aimed at the wrong car. The crash was huge, like a bomb. The first car, the one he had hit, ploughed into a tree trunk, its bonnet burst open, its windscreen gone, half its roof caved in. It seemed to have split and exploded. The car behind, undamaged until this point, crashed into its rear and its boot lid sprang open. That was the silver Honda which had been his quarry. As its driver got out of it, screaming, her hands up in the air, he knew he had failed. <br><br>He waited no longer but picked up the backpack and moved, looking back once to see the leading car burst into flames. In the brilliant light which illuminated everything he saw for the first time the woman he had tried to kill.</p><h2>Transformation (Rai Kirah)</h2><p>Seyonne is a man waiting to die.

The ground was barren, scrub sprouting here and there out of the dirt. Across the yard stood an old windmill, the kind with the tiller and the spoked wheel. Farther down the road he spied a telephone pole strung with wires. Beneath it sat the rusted carcass of an ancient tractor. He sighed. The place had probably looked the same in 1933.<br><br>&#x201c;Stay back a ways once he pulls in. Don&#x2019;t want to spook him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Now you&#x2019;re even talking like a cowboy,&#x201d; said Fergus Keefe, a supervisory special agent from the Cyber Investigations Division and his colead on the case. &#x201c;That ought to go over big in D.C.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t there yet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If half of what Felix says is true, this is your ticket to the show.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll believe it when I&#x2019;m holding the plane ticket in my hand.&#x201d;<br><br>Sacramento&#x2019;s the last stop, they&#x2019;d promised him. You&#x2019;ll get to D.C. straight after that. But that was before Semaphore came around. Semaphore threw a wrench into everything. If he wasn&#x2019;t so good at his job, Joe thought, he&#x2019;d be in Washington right now, looking at the dome of the Capitol Building and giving briefings on the Hill. Instead he was parked in the questionable shade of a cedar tree on an abandoned cattle ranch smack dab in the middle of Texas Hill Country. D.C. might as well be on the far side of the moon.<br><br>&#x201c;Felix is turning onto RR 3410,&#x201d; said Keefe.<br><br>&#x201c;Roger that. Wait right there. He sees that dust behind him, there&#x2019;s no telling what he&#x2019;ll do. He&#x2019;s nervous enough as it is.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Felix&#x201d; was the confidential informant&#x2019;s code name. For Felix Unger, the OCD half of the Odd Couple.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m pulling over,&#x201d; said Keefe. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s all yours. And don&#x2019;t take any chances.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You think he&#x2019;s packing? Felix? A PhD from MIT? The guy&#x2019;s annual 401(k) contribution is bigger than my entire salary.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I prefer to think of him as a pill-popping drunk with two DUIs and a reckless endangerment under his belt.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Point taken.&#x201d; Joe laid a hand on his Glock. Tell an agent to be careful and he&#x2019;s going to check that his piece is where it should be&#x2014;in Joe&#x2019;s case, holstered on his waist, butt facing out for the cross draw. He forgot about the weapon and switched off his phone, staring at the picture of Jessie and Grace on his wallpaper. He ran a fingernail over their faces, but it didn&#x2019;t bring them any closer. Getting so big. He said it every time, just like he said he&#x2019;d be home more often and he&#x2019;d stop letting &#x201c;the job&#x201d; take precedence over his job as a father.<br><br>Someday . . . <br><br>Joe drummed his fingers on the steering wheel. The exterior temperature gauge read 102, but it felt hotter. Across the yard a clump of tumbleweed rustled. He leaned forward, eyes glued to the windmill. Come on, he whispered. Give us a breeze. The windmill shuddered but did not turn.<br><br>Times had changed. You didn&#x2019;t need a windmill to pump water out of the ground. And you sure as heck didn&#x2019;t need wires to send a voice from one person to another. Joe knew all about phones and cables and all things telecommunication. He knew more about digital technology than he&#x2019;d ever wanted to. Semaphore had taken care of that.<br><br>Officially it was Operation Semaphore, and it had brought him to Austin two months earlier. For the record it was a routine transfer, a lateral move from Sacramento to shore up the Austin residency&#x2019;s glaring manpower shortage. He came billed as an agent who knew his way around municipal corruption cases, with a stint overseas policing piracy of intellectual property.<br><br>But the record didn&#x2019;t say everything.<br><br>There were rumors about a chronic inability to follow orders. People said that Joe Grant was a cowboy who left a trail of wreckage in his wake. They said that Austin was his last watering hole and that he couldn&#x2019;t retire soon enough. And whatever you do, don&#x2019;t partner up with him.<br><br>The rumors were bullshit&#x2014;disinformation designed to give him leeway to act on his own. No one knew about Semaphore except Joe, Keefe, and the task force in D.C.<br><br>The sound of an engine made him sit up straighter. He caught a flash of red in the rearview. It was Felix&#x2019;s Ferrari. Joe believed the model was called a LaFerrari, and it retailed for a cool million five. It was also the most conspicuous car on the face of the planet. He felt certain the boys up in the space station could see it right now with just their eyes.<br><br>Felix parked close behind Joe&#x2019;s car. A scrawny man with a mop of dark hair climbed out and hurried over. The door opened and Felix slid into the seat, eyes bugging, sweat rolling down his forehead. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to need a bigger boat,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Relax,&#x201d; said Joe. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re safe here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Safe. Yeah, right. You got no idea.&#x201d; Felix spun and peered over his shoulder. His eyes were red-rimmed and sagging with fatigue. He might have just pulled an all-nighter banging out code at the office, but Felix didn&#x2019;t bang out code anymore. Felix&#x2019;s real name was Hal Stark, and Stark was senior vice president for special projects at ONE Technologies, the biggest tech company in the United States. ONE was a player in everything: software, hardware, online sales, wireless communications; a gargantuan cross of Oracle, Google, Cisco, and AT&amp;T.<br><br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you take a breath, chill for a second. Then you can give me an idea.&#x201d; Joe pulled a pack of Juicy Fruit from his pocket. &#x201c;A stick of gum makes you hum.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that from?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What movie? I don&#x2019;t know. My wife says it sometimes. Have a stick.&#x201d;<br><br>Stark pulled out two and folded the chewing gum into a double-thick square before ramming it into his mouth. A moment later he was checking over his shoulder again.<br><br>Joe lowered both windows. &#x201c;Hear that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What? I don&#x2019;t hear anything.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Exactly. This is Dripping Springs. Austin is twenty-five miles in the other direction. No one&#x2019;s on your tail. We&#x2019;ve been watching you the whole way out. You didn&#x2019;t bring your phone, did you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, then. We checked your car earlier. It&#x2019;s clean. As far as anyone knows or cares, you left the office for a doctor&#x2019;s appointment. You&#x2019;re safe.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All right, then. I believe you. I&#x2019;m safe.&#x201d;<br><br>Joe put a hand on Stark&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;You have any problem getting it out?&#x201d;<br><br>Stark pepped up. &#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t take a second look. The security guard had it right there in his hand. He had no idea he was holding the crown jewels.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What did I tell you?&#x201d; Joe looked at the Ferrari&#x2019;s nose in his rearview mirror. &#x201c;Is there anything about that car that&#x2019;s inconspicuous?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the point,&#x201d; said Stark. &#x201c;Nothing&#x2019;s run-of-the-mill on that car.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Anyway, thank you, Hal. On behalf of the United States government, we are grateful. Now give me the goods, let me tape you swearing that you downloaded the information of your own free will, and we&#x2019;ll cut you loose. No one will ever learn about your cooperation.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My ass,&#x201d; said Stark. &#x201c;What about you? You get the DUIs off my record?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Expunged is the word,&#x201d; said Joe. &#x201c;And yes, both have been expunged from your record.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That was cheap,&#x201d; said Stark. &#x201c;Preying on a man&#x2019;s weaknesses like that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A guy like you can&#x2019;t afford to hire a driver? That&#x2019;s the second time you were popped in the past twelve months. And next time make sure your date isn&#x2019;t a minor.&#x201d;<br><br>The DUI was their way in, the chink in the enemy&#x2019;s armor. Stark was right. It was cheap, but Joe had to use what he was given. He&#x2019;d yet to meet an informant who volunteered his services of his own free will.<br><br>&#x201c;The pressure,&#x201d; said Stark. &#x201c;You have no idea. He&#x2019;s relentless. Always more. Always better. Always faster. He&#x2019;s not human, I swear it. He&#x2019;s some kind of superman. No . . . a supermachine. Men have feelings. He says he&#x2019;s beyond feeling. He&#x2019;s proud of it. He says he&#x2019;s &#x2018;becoming.&#x2019; Can you believe that? Becoming what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, Hal. Let&#x2019;s calm down. Just begin at the beginning. You&#x2019;ll feel better once it&#x2019;s off your chest.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And you expunged the felony, too?&#x201d;<br><br>Yes, Joe said. He had.<br><br>Hal Stark sat up straighter. &#x201c;All right, then, the first thing you need to know is that you don&#x2019;t know the half of it. What you guys found&#x2014;the reason you came after me&#x2014;that&#x2019;s the tip of the iceberg . . . no, no . . . the tip of the tip.&#x201d;<br><br>Joe took this in without comment. He felt the hackles on his neck stand up as they always did when he was about to get the goods. &#x201c;Go on.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The incursion . . . well, you know that wasn&#x2019;t the first time, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>The incursion referred to a hack of the FBI&#x2019;s mainframe eight months earlier that had triggered the red flags and gotten Semaphore off the ground.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Joe lied. &#x201c;Exactly how long has it been going on?&#x201d;<br><br>Stark laughed. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t know. Well, like I said, he&#x2019;s a supermachine. Amazing you found it in the first place.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re no slouches ourselves.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You might want to reserve comment until I&#x2019;m done.&#x201d;<br><br>Joe looked away, drawn by the rustling of the large tumbleweed. Finally a breeze. He glanced at the windmill, but the wheel didn&#x2019;t budge. He looked back and the tumbleweed was still.<br><br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; asked Stark.<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; said Joe. &#x201c;Keep going.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all about the company we just bought. The one that caused all the headlines.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Merriweather,&#x201d; said Joe.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, it builds the fastest supercomputer in the world, called Titan. He&#x2019;s got plans for it.&#x201d; Stark shook his head. &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t believe it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to need a bigger boat.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You sure as hell are,&#x201d; said Stark.<br><br>Joe kept his eyes on the tumbleweed. He decided the heat was playing tricks on him. Nothing moved without wind pushing it. There was no wind, so the tumbleweed couldn&#x2019;t have inched closer. He razzed himself for being paranoid. Once a sniper, always a sniper. Dripping Springs was not Iraq. Smiling, he looked back at Stark and saw it: a thin column of dust rising into the air five hundred yards behind them. Someone was approaching on the inbound road.<br><br>&#x201c;Everything okay?&#x201d; asked Stark.<br><br>&#x201c;Shut up.&#x201d; Joe picked up his phone. &#x201c;Boots, that you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Boots&#x201d; was Keefe&#x2019;s nickname, earned God knows how or when.<br><br>No one responded.<br><br>&#x201c;Boots, come back.&#x201d;<br><br>Stark turned halfway around in his seat to peer out the back window.<br><br>&#x201c;Get down,&#x201d; said Joe, as he drew his weapon and thumbed the safety off.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d; asked Stark, eyes locked on the pistol. &#x201c;I thought you said no one followed me.&#x201d;<br><br>Joe started the car. &#x201c;Buckle your seat belt. The ride may get a little bumpy.&#x201d;<br><br>Stark muttered something, then elbowed the door open and threw himself out of the car.<br><br>&#x201c;Get back here,&#x201d; said Joe.<br><br>&#x201c;I can take care of myself.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Get inside.&#x201d;<br><br>Stark looked around the clearing. &#x201c;Government never protected anyone.

Where that line about the gum came&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>Stark&#x2019;s head exploded in a spray of blood and brain and he dropped to the ground.<br><br>Joe caught a muzzle flash from inside the tumbleweed. No rifle report. A sniper like him.<br><br>Desperately he slammed the Tahoe into drive. The windshield shattered. He threw himself flat onto the seat and a second bullet struck his headrest. He drove blindly for a few seconds, then raised his head. A bullet hit the steering wheel, cracking it. Another hit the engine block. Steam escaped from beneath the hood. The car ground to a halt.<br><br>Joe lay still. His phone had fallen into the footwell. He picked it up and dialed. &#x201c;Answer,&#x201d; he whispered feverishly. &#x201c;Pick up. Please.&#x201d;<br><br>He heard a car stop behind him. Doors opening. Male voices. The unmistakable metal crunch of a clip being loaded into an automatic weapon.<br><br>Joe held the phone to his ear. &#x201c;Come on. Pick up.&#x201d;<br><br>The phone answered. &#x201c;Hi. This is Mary. I can&#x2019;t take your call right now, but if you leave a message, I&#x2019;ll get back to you as soon as possible.

Rush hour started early in Austin.<br><br>&#x201c;Everyone doing okay?&#x201d; she asked, looking over her shoulder.<br><br>Grace gazed out the window, sipping her Sonic limeade, her thoughts a million miles away. Jessie sat beside her, headphones on, eyes glued to Mary&#x2019;s phone, fingers ferociously tapping away.<br><br>&#x201c;Jess, hon, what are you doing with Mom&#x2019;s phone?&#x201d; asked Mary.<br><br>Jessie didn&#x2019;t answer.<br><br>&#x201c;She can hear you,&#x201d; said Grace. &#x201c;She just doesn&#x2019;t feel like answering.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s she doing?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. Probably Instagramming.&#x201d;<br><br>Mary watched Jessie&#x2019;s fingers go pat-pat-pat on the glass surface. More like writing an article for the encyclopedia, she thought. She could feel the throbbing bass of the music assaulting her teenage daughter&#x2019;s eardrums, an angry voice shouting something she knew she&#x2019;d rather not understand. &#x201c;Jessie?&#x201d;<br><br>The cars in front of them began to move, and Mary forgot about the phone.

She&#x2019;d even managed to lose six pounds so she could fit into her favorite little black dress.

The twentieth century has witnessed suffering and human cruelty on a scale never before imagined. Yet, paradoxically, in recent years the doctrine of original sin has suffered neglect and ridicule. In this philosophically sophisticated treatment of the biblical evidence for original sin, Henri Blocher offers a robust response. Interacting with the best theological thinking on the subject, this New Studies in Biblical Theology volume shows that while the nature of original sin is a mystery&#x2015;even a riddle&#x2015;only belief in it makes sense of evil and wrongdoing. After a general survey of the biblical evidence, Blocher moves on to discuss the two key texts. First, he considers the relation of the Eden story of Genesis 2 and 3 to modern scientific, literary and theological thinking. Then, he offers a new and groundbreaking interpretation of Romans 5, where Paul discusses Christ and Adam. From this exegetical foundation, he goes on to show how the doctrine of original sin makes sense of the paradoxes of human existence. In the final chapter, he discusses the intellectual difficulties that some feel remain with the doctrine itself. Addressing key issues in biblical theology, the works comprising New Studies in Biblical Theology are creative attempts to help Christians better understand their Bibles. The NSBT series is edited by D. A. Carson, aiming to simultaneously instruct and to edify, to interact with current scholarship and to point the way ahead</p><p>In October 2003, Henri Blocher was appointed to the Guenther H. Knoedler Chair of Theology at Wheaton College in Wheaton, Illinois. Since 1965 he has served as professor of systematic theology at the Facult� Libre de Th�ologie Evang�lique in Vaux-sur-Seine near Paris, France. A leading evangelical theologian and statesman, Blocher was a member of the Lausanne Committee on World Evangelization (1975-1980), served the World Evangelical Fellowship/Alliance in a number of capacities, and taught in schools in Europe, Australia, Africa, Canada and the US. He is currently president of the Fellowship of European Evangelical Theologians. Blocher studied at a number of institutions including the Sorbonne, London Bible College, Gordon Divinity School, and Facult� Libre de Th�ologie Protestant of Paris. He has written six books, four of which have appeared in English, and several dozen articles. His English publications include <em>Original Sin: Illuminating the Riddle, Evil and the Cross: Christian Thought and the Problem of Evil</em> and <em>In the Beginning: The Opening chapters of Genesis.</em>Blocher, who teaches systematic theology at the Faculte Libre de Theologie Evangelique, Vaux-sur-Seine, France, approaches original sin as a riddle. As he sees it, the riddle arises not so much from original sin as from the widespread denial of the concept in a century marked by unprecedented violence and cruelty. After a general survey of biblical material, Blocher turns to Paul's discussion in Romans 5 of the relationship between Christ and Adam. He contends that a close reading of the fall of Adam does not bear the interpretation that Adam's sin and guilt were transferred to later generations. Rather, he asserts, the freedom of Adam's will to choose evil represents "an inborn state" that results in alienation from God. Freedom of the will is part of the human condition and that freedom entails a hereditary separation from God. However, Blocher sees this state as a "gate of hope" that opens humanity to compassion rather than despair. "Recognizing our radical separation from God and our potentail to choose evil should lead not to condemnation but to compassion." says Blocher. His account of original sin goes far in rehabilitating the doctrine of original sin from its traditionally negative associations. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Encyclopedia of Western Gunfighters</h2><p><p>Much information (some of it factual, a lot of it fictional) is available about the famous gunfighters of the Old West&#x2015;the Jameses, Billy the Kid, Wild Bill Hickok, Wyatt Earp, John Wesley Hardin, and that latter-day folk idol, Butch Cassidy.

Constant clouds made for soft light; soft light that cast no shadows. And John liked to avoid shadows as much as possible. </p><p> As he passed through the elaborate gate that marked the entrance to Addison's Walk, he looked down at his watch, checking his progress, then looked again. The watch had stopped, and not for the first time. It had been a gift from his youngest child, his only daughter, and while her love in the gift was evident, the selection had been made from a child's point of view and was therefore more aesthetic than practical. The case was burnished gold (although it was most certainly gold-colored tin), the face was painted with spring flowers, and on the back was the embossed image of a frog wearing a bonnet. </p><p> John had absentmindedly pulled it out of his pocket during one of the frequent gatherings of his friends at Magdalen, much to their amusement. Barfield in particular loved to approach him now at inopportune moments just to ask the time -- and hopefully embarrass John in the process. </p><p> John sighed and tucked the watch back in his pocket, then pulled his collar tighter and hurried on. He was probably already late for the dinner he'd been invited to at the college, and although he had always been punctual (mostly), events of recent years had made him much more aware of the consequences tardiness can bring. </p><p> Five years earlier, after a sudden and unexpected journey to the Archipelago of Dreams, he'd found himself a half hour late for an evening with visiting friends that had been planned by his wife. Even had he not taken an oath of secrecy regarding the Archipelago, he would scarcely have been able to explain that he was late because he'd been saving Peter Pan's granddaughter and thousands of other children from the Pied Piper, and had only just returned via a magic wardrobe in Sir James Barrie's house, and so had still needed to drive home from London. </p><p> His wife, however, still made the occasional remark about his having been late for the party. So John had since resolved to be as punctual as possible in every circumstance. And tonight he was certain that Jack would not want to be on his own for long, even if the third member of their dinner meeting was their good and trusted friend, Hugo Dyson. </p><p> </p><p> Hugo had become part of a loose association of like-minded fellows, centered around Jack and John, who gathered together to read, discuss, and debate literature, Romanticism, and the nature of the universe, among other things. The group had evolved from an informal club at Oxford that John had called the Coalbiters, which was mostly concerned with the history and mythology of the Northern lands. One of the members of the current gathering referred to them jokingly as the "not-so-secret secret society," but where John and Jack were concerned, the name was more ironic than funny. They frequently held other meetings attended only by themselves and their friend Charles, as often as he could justify the trip from London to Oxford, in which they discussed matters that their colleagues would find impossible to believe. For rather than discussing the meaning of metaphor in ancient texts of fable and fairy tale, what was discussed in this <i>actually</i> secret secret society were the fables and fairy tales themselves...which were <i>real.</i> And existed in another world just beyond reach of our own. A world called the Archipelago of Dreams. </p><p> </p><p> John, Jack, and Charles had been recruited to be Caretakers of the <i>Imaginarium Geographica,</i> the great atlas of the Archipelago. Accepting the job brought with it many other responsibilities, including the welfare of the Archipelago itself and the peoples within it. The history of the atlas and its Caretakers amounted to a secret history of the world, and sometimes each of them felt the full weight of that burden; for events in the Archipelago are often mirrored in the natural world, and what happens in one can affect the other. </p><p> In the fourteen years since they first became Caretakers, all three men had become distinguished as both scholars and writers in and around Oxford, as had been the tradition with other Caretakers across the ages. There were probably many other creative men and women in other parts of the world who might have had the aptitude for it, but the pattern had been set centuries earlier by Roger Bacon, who was himself an Oxford scholar and one of the great compilers of the Histories of the Archipelago. </p><p> The very nature of the <i>Geographica</i> and the accompanying Histories meant that discussing them or the Archipelago with anyone in the natural world was verboten. At various points in history, certain Caretakers-in-training had disagreed with this doctrine and had been removed from their positions. Some, like Harry Houdini and Arthur Conan Doyle, were nearly eaten by the dragons that guarded the Frontier, the barrier between the world and the Archipelago, before giving up the job. Others, like the adventurer Sir Richard Burton, were cast aside in a less dramatic fashion but had become more dangerous in the years that followed. </p><p> In fact, Burton had nearly cost them their victory in their second conflict with the Winter King -- with his shadow, to be more precise -- and had ended up escaping with one of the great Dragonships. He had not been seen since. But John suspected he was out there somewhere, watching and waiting. </p><p> Burton himself may have been the best argument for Caretaker secrecy. The knowledge of the Archipelago bore with it the potential for great destruction, but Burton was blind to the danger, believing that knowledge was neither good nor evil -- only the uses to which it was put could be. It was the trait that made him a great explorer, and an unsuitable Caretaker. </p><p> Because of the oath of secrecy, there was no one on Earth with whom the three Caretakers could discuss the Archipelago, save for their mentor Bert, who was in actuality H. G. Wells, and on occasion, James Barrie. But Barrie, called Jamie by the others, was the rare exception to Burton's example: He was a Caretaker who gave up the job willingly. And as such, John had realized early on that the occasional visit to reminisce was fine -- but Jamie wanted no part of anything of substance that dealt with the Archipelago. </p><p> What made keeping the secret difficult was that John, Jack, and Charles had found a level of comfortable intellectualism within their academic and writing careers. A pleasant camaraderie had developed among their peers at the colleges, and it became more and more tempting to share the secret knowledge that was theirs as Caretakers. John had even suspected that Jack may have already said something to his closest friend, his brother Warnie -- but he could hardly fault him for that. Warnie could be trusted, and he had actually seen the girl Laura Glue, when she'd crashed into his and Jack's garden, wings askew, five years earlier, asking about the Caretakers. </p><p> But privately, each of them had wondered if one of their friends at Oxford might not be inducted into their circle as an apprentice, or Caretaker-in-training of sorts. After all, that was how Bert and his predecessor, Jules Verne, had recruited their successors. In fact, Bert still maintained files of study on potential Caretakers, young and old, for his three prot�g�s to observe from afar. Within the circle at Oxford, there were at least two among their friends who would qualify in matters of knowledge and creative thinking: Owen Barfield and Hugo Dyson. John expected that sometime in the future, he, Jack, and Charles would likely summon one (or both) colleagues for a long discussion of myth, and history, and languages, and then, after a hearty dinner and good drink, they would unveil the <i>Imaginarium Geographica</i> with a flourish, and thus induct their fellow or fellows into the ranks of the Caretakers. Other candidates might be better qualified than the Oxford dons, but familiarity begat comfort, and comfort begat trust. And in a Caretaker, trust was one of the most important qualities of all. </p><p> But none of them had anticipated having such a meeting as a matter of necessity, under circumstances that might have mortal consequences for one of their friends. Among them, Jack especially was wary of this. He had lost friends in two worlds and was reluctant to put another at risk if he could help it. </p><p> He had requested that all three of them meet for dinner with Hugo Dyson on the upcoming Saturday rather than their usual Thursday gathering time, but as it turned out, Charles was doing research for a novel in the catacombs beneath Paris and could not be reached. He'd been expected back that very day, but as they had heard nothing from him, and he had not yet appeared back in London, John and Jack decided that the meeting was too important to delay, and they confirmed the appointment with Hugo for that evening. It was agreed that the best place for it was in Jack's rooms at Magdalen. They met there often, and so no one observing them would find anything amiss; but the rooms also afforded a degree of privacy they could not get in the open dining halls or local taverns, should the discussion turn to matters best kept secret. </p><p> This was almost inevitable, John realized with a shudder of trepidation, given the nature of the matter he and Jack needed to broach with Hugo. Oddly enough, it was actually Charles who was responsible for setting the events in motion, or rather, a small package that had been addressed to him and that he'd subsequently forwarded to Jack at Magdalen. Charles worked at the Oxford University Press, which was based in London, and very few people knew of his connection to Jack at all -- much less knew enough to address the parcel, "Mr. Charles Williams, Caretaker." Charles sent it to Jack, with the instruction that he open it together with John -- and Hugo Dyson. </p><p> Invoking the title of...</p></p><h2>Bonkers: My Life in Laughs</h2><p><b>The hilarious, touching life story of the creator of <i>AbFab </i>and one of most brilliant minds in comedy</b><br><br>Jennifer Saunders' comic creations have brought joy to millions.

Among them were the Mongols of the thirteenth century - a small tribe, which, under the charismatic leadership of Genghis Khan, created the largest contiguous land empire in history. Inspired by the extraordinary life nomads still lead today, Tim Cope embarked on a journey that hadn&#39;t been successfully completed since those times: to travel on horseback across the entire length of the Eurasian steppe, from Karakorum, the ancient capital of Mongolia, through Kazakhstan, Russia, Crimea and the Ukraine to the Danube River in Hungary. From horse-riding novice to travelling three years and 10,000 kilometres on horseback, accompanied by his dog Tigon, Tim learnt to fend off wolves and would-be horse-thieves, and grapple with the extremes of the steppe as he crossed sub-zero plateaux, the scorching deserts of Kazakhstan and the high-mountain passes of the Carpathians. Along the way, he was taken in by people who taught him the traditional ways and told him their recent history: Stalin&#39;s push for industrialisation brought calamity to the steepe and forced collectivism that in Kazakhstan alone led to the loss of several million livestock and the starvation of more than a million nomads. Today Cope bears witness to how the traditional ways hang precariously in the balance in the post-Soviet world.</p><p>Tim Cope, F.R.G.S., is an adventurer, author, filmmaker and motivational speaker with a special interest in Central Asia and the states of the former Soviet Union. He has studied as a wilderness guide in the Finnish and Russian subarctic, ridden a bicycle across Russia to China, and rowed a boat along the Yenisey River through Siberia to the Arctic Ocean. He is the author of Off the Rails: Moscow to Beijing on Recumbent Bikes. He is the creator of several documentary films, including the award-winning series &#39;The Trail of Genghis Khan&#39;, which covers the journey of this book. He lives in Victoria, Australia. www.timcopejourneys.comTim Cope is a wise young man who knows how to travel, and why, and which details to record for the delight and enlightenment of his readers. I suspect that here we have a classic, likely to inspire generations yet unborn * <b>Dervla Murphy</b> * Tim Cope's exploration across the continents on horseback grew into a quest through history and then an odyssey deep into the human heart. In exploring some of the most remote places on earth, he brings us back to ourselves and to a better understanding of our place in the world today * <b>Jack Weatherford, author of <i>Genghis Khan: And the Making of the Modern World</i></b> * Three years, 10,000km and -30 DegreesC temperatures: Tim Cope's horseback traverse of the Eurasian Steppe - Mongolia to Hungary - is full of hardship, characters and insights ... It's a big undertaking for readers too, but it opens up a vast, little-trodden world of history, danger and adventure * <i><b>Wanderlust</b></i> * It is the ultimate boy's own adventure. In an epic 6,000 mile journey on horseback, lasting for more than three gruelling years, Tim Cope braved dangers, scorching deserts, subzero mountain temperatures and some of the world's most inhospitable terrain. Most of us would not survive even a day in the windswept wilderness and wolf-infested plateaux of Mongolia and Kazakhstan, but Cope was determined to follow a childhood dream * <b>Dalya Alberge, <i>Sunday Times</i></b> * One of the most vibrant and engaging narrators you might find ... It is a vast journey enjoyably meandering in an age of Twitter soundbites ... By turns informative, gripping and very moving: a major endeavour, which flings off the straightjacket of its sub-genre and stands (or rides) alone * <b>Joanna Kavenna, <i>Spectator</i></b> * Reading On The Trail, it is impossible to not get swept up in Tim's infectious sense of adventure. His story is an amazing one, but he also approaches it in such a way that you'll think that it might be possible for you to attempt an epic adventure of your own. That's the kind of inspiration that Tim creates through his writing * <i><b>TheAdventureBlog</b></i> * New book inspires Mongolia visits: Intrepid travellers looking for destinations that are genuinely off the beaten track have been inspired by a new book by the Australian adventurer Tim Cope in which he describes a journey by horseback following in the steps of the legendary Genghis Khan * <b>Adrian Bridge, <i>Daily Telegraph</i></b> * This great journey gives the lie to any notion that the world is too much known. It's an astonishing feat of courage and imagination, travelling in its own rich dimension - of nomad history and the horse. * Colin Thubron * Tim Cope is a beautiful explorer - by which I mean that he explores beautiful places, but also that he does it beautifully. This is a young man possessed of extraordinary courage, but also great sensitivity and respect. His writing, like his journeys, speaks to a heightened soul, operating at its highest potential. He is an inspiration to me and I believe he will be an inspiration for many. To anyone who believes that there are no worlds left to be discovered, I offer up the evidence of this magnificent tale * Elizabeth Gilbert *</p><h2>Stromatolites: Ancient, Beautiful, and Earth-Altering</h2><p>A colorful look at 3.5 billion years of stromatolites, peculiar structures produced by primitive life forms that lived over vast spans of geologic time. At once diverse, attractive, and sometimes puzzling, fossilized stromatolites are found worldwide in sedimentary rocks&#x2014;often presenting striking patterns&#x2014;where they grew in ancient bodies of water that covered parts of the earth billions of years before the dinosaurs. This reference presents a basic, nontechnical account, along with 636 beautiful images of these most ancient of Earthly collectibles. Stromatolites, and the cyanobacteria that produced most of them, were responsible not only for the fossils themselves, but also, more importantly, for the introduction of free oxygen into the planet&#x2019;s atmosphere. Covering a diverse variety of stromatolites and the geologic objects that can resemble them, this book is a delight for stromatophiles as well as those curious about the early Earth.</p><p>Bob Leis is an avid admirer and collector of stromatolites, algal mats, and any rocks of a stromatolitic and biogenic origin. Bruce L. Stinchcomb, a retired professor of geology, has an interest in stromatolites, the oldest clear evidence for life.</p><h2>Tun-huang (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p>More than a thousand years ago, an extraordinary trove of early Buddhist sutras and other scriptures was secreted away in caves near the Silk Road city of Tun-huang. But who hid this magnificent treasure and why? In&nbsp;<i>Tun-huang</i>, the great modern Japanese novelist Yasushi Inoue tells the story of Chao Hsing-te, a young Chinese man whose accidental failure to take the all-important exam that will qualify him as a high government official leads to a chance encounter that draws him farther and farther into the wild and contested lands west of the Chinese Empire. Here he finds love, distinguishes himself in battle, and ultimately devotes himself to the strange task of depositing the scrolls in the caves where, many centuries later, they will be rediscovered. A book of magically vivid scenes, fierce passions, and astonishing adventures,&nbsp;<i>Tun-huang</i>&nbsp;is also a profound and stirring meditation on the mystery of history and the hidden presence of the past.</p><p><p>Yasushi Inoue (1907&#x2013;1991) was born on Hokkaid&#x14d;, Japan&#x2019;s northernmost island, the eldest child of an army medical officer. After a youth devoted to poetry and judo, Inoue sat, unsuccessfully, for the entrance exam to the Kyushu Imperial University Medical School. He would go on to study philosophy and literature at Kyoto Imperial University, writing his thesis on Paul Val�ry. In 1935, newly married and with an infant daughter, Inoue became an arts reporter for the Osaka edition of the <i>Mainichi News</i>. Following the Second World War, during which he briefly served in north China, he published two short novels,<i> The Hunting Gun</i> and <i>The Bullfight (</i>winner of the Akutagawa Prize for literature). In 1951 Inoue resigned from the newspaper and devoted himself to literature, becoming a best-selling and tremendously prolific author in multiple genres. Among his books translated into English are <i>The Hunting Gun, The Roof Tile of Tempy&#x14d;,</i> and <i>The Blue Wolf: A Novel of the Life of Chinggis Khan</i>. In 1976 the emperor of Japan presented Inoue with the Order of Culture, the highest honor granted for artistic merit in Japan.<br> Jean Oda Moy was born in Washington State and spent her early years in Seattle, moving to Japan shortly before the outbreak of World War II . She is also the<i> translator of Yasushi Inoue&#x2019;s Chronicle of My Mother and </i>Shirobamba: A Childhood In Old Japan.<br> Damion Searls is the author of <i>What We Were Doing and Where We Were Going</i> and an award-winning translator, most recently of Rainer Maria Rilke&#x2019;s <i>The Inner Sky</i>:<i> Poems, Notes, Dreams,</i> Jon Fosse&#x2019;s <i>Aliss at the Fire</i>, and Hans Keilson&#x2019;s <i>Comedy in a Minor Key.</i> NYRB Classics has published his abridged edition of Henry David Thoreau&#x2019;s <i>Journal</i> and will publish his translations of the Dutch writer Nescio&#x2019;s short stories and Andr� Gide&#x2019;s <i>Marshlands</i>.<br></p>The sound of the neighing of horses and hoofbeats approached the two men with a roar like that of raging surf. Hsing-te saw them come. A huge group of soldiers, who had apparently come from behind a hill, suddenly appeared about thirty yards in front of him and charged forward, covering the surface of the earth like ants. In the vast desert, their direction left no room for doubt that the soldiers were advancing at the two men. <p>Suddenly Hsing-te felt the necklace snap at his fingertips, then he somersaulted backward and fell. The next moment, he was knocked over by the violent impact of the gigantic force which rushed forward; Hsing-te rolled over a few times down the gentle slope and landed in a ditch. Above him, the black hordes flowed by thunderously. Only a short time had passed, but to Hsing-te it had seemed interminable. </p><p>When he regained consciousness, he found that he was completely covered by sand in the ditch. He tried to get up, but he couldn't. He wasn't sure whether he had been run over by horses or had been bruised as he rolled down the slope. His whole body ached. It was miraculous that he had survived at all. Hsing-te looked up at the sky as he lay there. He couldn't move, but discovering that only his right arm was mobile, he moved it slowly around and felt himself. As he did this, he was startled by something and instinctively raised his arm. The broken string of the necklace had caught round his fingers and hung limply. Not a single stone was left on it. No doubt the stones had scattered the instant the string had snapped. </p><p>Night fell slowly. The pale moon gradually grew brighter and soon shone with a reddish glow. Hsing-te felt faint as he stared fixedly at the sky. The stars began to glimmer around the moon, then filled the heavens. His mind was blank. For some reason, he did not even feel the cold. But he was hungry. If only he could get a drop of water. He looked around, but naturally there was nothing in sight. There was only the vast sandy plain.</p></p><h2>Sean Scully: Walls of Aran</h2><p><p><strong>A new, compact edition of Sean Scully&#x2019;s photographs, featuring horizontal and vertical shards of limestone that echo his painted work and reveal a creative process best expressed through abstract shapes.</strong></p><p>Sean Scully, one of today&#x2019;s most esteemed painters and an accomplished photographer, spent time on the remote Aran Islands, off the west coast of Ireland, photographing the ancient drystone walls that crisscross the stark and barren landscape. <em>Sean Scully</em> brings together his sensitive images, revealing the unexpected yet monumental beauty of these centuries-old structures that meander across the windswept and rocky islands.

We are all aware of their often extraordinary talent and manoeuvres on the city streets. This book is the first detailed study of the urban phenomenon of skateboarding. It looks at skateboarding history from the surf-beaches of California in the 1950s, through the purpose-built skateparks of the 1970s, to the street-skating of the present day and shows how skateboarders experience and understand the city through their sport. Dismissive of authority and convention, skateboarders suggest that the city is not just a place for working and shopping but a true pleasure-ground, a place where the human body, emotions and energy can be expressed to the full.</p><p>The huge skateboarding subculture that revolves around graphically-designed clothes and boards, music, slang and moves provides a rich resource for exploring issues of gender, race, class, sexuality and the family. As the author demonstrates, street-style skateboarding, especially characteristic of recent decades, conducts a performative critique of architecture, the city and capitalism. Anyone interested in the history and sociology of sport, urban geography or architecture will find this book riveting.</p></p><p>Iain Borden Director of Architectural History and Theory and Reader in Architecture and Urban Culture at the Bartlett,University College London<p>&#x201c;Those few of us in the academy engaged in writing about the sociospatial relations of skating delight in the polished arguments that Borden presents over nine logically structured, pertinent and stylishly illustrated chapters.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Cultural Geographies</i></p><p>&#x201c;Borden describes the emergence of not so much a sport as a way of life ... Its relation to architecture is kept beautifully clear ... a good read.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Building Design</i></p><p>&#x201c;Skateboarders help us to think about buildings and their use. Borden argues that they draw our attention to the city as the site of perpetual change.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Independent</i></p><p>&#x201c;The first academic study of skateboarding.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Dazed and Confused</i></p><p>&#x201c;There's absolutely no way I can do [the] work justice here the book is incredibly thought-provoking, especially from the perspective of actually being a skateboarder. I highly recommend it.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Sidewalk</i></p><p>&#x201c;A fine book that I recommend to any skateboarder who can read at a college level.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Big Brother</i></p><p>&#x201c;Borden owes as much to 30 years' of personal passion and experience as he does to any architectural or social theory.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Architect's Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;[The book] delineates an architectural history, as yet largely unwritten, which focuses upon 'processes, possibilities, reproduction, performance and use.' Skateboarding, Space and the City reads the city through body and board - not merely through books. At a moment when architecture history/theory consists primarily of regurgitated texts intelligently referenced, inclusion of 'fieldwork' makes Borden's book an invaluable contribution to the field.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Archis</i></p><p>&#x201c;[This book shows] a clearly detailed knowledge of both his chosen theoretical approach and the magazines of the skating community.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>City</i></p><p>&#x201c;This is an amazing book and a real surprise A first. Pick it up and you'll learn something interesting about the cities you skate in; you might even learn something about skating itself.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Slap Skateboard Magazine</i></p><p>&#x201c;Even if you don't like books, this book is wicked This book is about you. It is not written by another 'band wagon jumper oner'. Iain Borden is a rare breed I'd like to meet this man and shake him by the hand. He is on our side.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Love 'N' Skate</i></p></p><h2>Standing as Awareness: The Direct Path</h2><p><p>Inspired by Sri Atmananda (Krishna Menon), the Direct Path is a &#x201c;pathless path.&#x201d; It simply articulates the being of you and the world as loving, open, clear awareness. If this truth is realized as your experience, then nothing need be done. The path disappears, and life is lived in sweetness and celebration! But if there are still questions or doubts, the Direct Path contains unique and powerful resources that stabilize this truth as your everyday reality. This is a revised edition of the book, expanded to add chapters on the Direct Path in addition to its selection of dialogs from a decade of &#x201c;Nondual Dinner&#x201d; gatherings. The first three chapters unfold the basics of the Direct Path, such as standing as awareness, being in love with awareness, and exploring awareness. Included are several experiments that help establish your everyday experience as awareness, always and already. The dialogs cover questions such as the desire for enlightenment experiences, the relationship between the brain and awareness, the question of &#x201c;nondually correct&#x201d; language, the belief in physical and mental objects, the idea of having a sage&#x2019;s experience, and more.</p><br></p><p><b>Greg Goode</b> is known for a unique combination of penetrating insight, comfort with both Eastern and Western sources, and a down-to-earth sense of humor.

Goode studied psychology at California State University, and philosophy at the University of Rochester and the Universit�t zu K�ln. He became drawn to self-inquiry initially through the work of Brand Blanshard, George Berkeley, the Chinmaya Mission, and Arsha Vidya Gurukulam.

With the lucidity and verve that have characterized his numerous earlier volumes, Howard Sachar breathes life into the leading dramatis personae of the Sephardic world: the royal counselors Samuel ibn Nagrela and Joseph Nasi, the poets Solomon ibn Gabirol and Judah Halevi, the philosophers Moses Maimonides and Baruch Spinoza, the statesmen Benjamin Disraeli and Pierre Mendes-France, the warriors Moshe Pijade and David Elazar, the fabulous charlatans David Reuveni and Shabbatai Zvi.<br><br>In its breadth and richness of texture, Sachar's account sweeps to the contemporary era of Mussolini, Hitler, and Franco, poignantly traces the fate of Balkan Sephardic communities during the Holocaust&#x2014;and their revival in the Land and State of Israel. Not least of all, the author offers a tactile dimension of immediacy in his personal encounters with the storied venues and current personalities of the Sephardic world. <i>Farewell Espana</i> is a window opened on a glowing civilization once all but extinguished, and now flickering again into renewed creativity.</p><p><b>Howard M.

Armed with spears or pikes, standing shoulder to shoulder, and with overlapping shields, they presented an impenetrable wall of wood and metal to the enemy. It was the phalanx that allowed Greece to become the dominant power in the Western world. That is, until the Romans developed the legion and cracked the phalanx.</p><p>In <i>Legion versus Phalanx</i> Cole weighs the two fighting forces against each other. Covering the period in which the legion and phalanx clashed (280--168 BC), he looks at each formation in detail--delving into their tactics, arms, and equipment, organization and the deployment. It then examines six key battles in which legion battled phalanx: Heraclea (280 BC), Asculum (279 BC), Beneventum (275 BC), Cynoscephalae (197 BC), Magnesia (190 BC), and Pydna (168 BC)--battles that determined the fate of the ancient world.

He was a young rider of distinction winning awards and trophies at horse shows throughout the United Kingdom.

Sweat ran off the end of my nose in a continuous stream and I could feel the heat deep in my chest as I breathed in the searing air. I&#x2019;d been in saunas before, but never one this hot. <br><br>&#x201c;So what do you want?&#x201d; I asked. My companion in this hellish place didn&#x2019;t answer. He simply stared at the floor between his feet. &#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; I said. <br><br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t come all this way for my health. It&#x2019;s far too bloody hot in here. You wanted to talk to me, so talk.&#x201d;<br><br>He lifted his head.&#x201c;At least you&#x2019;re not in one of these damn things.&#x201d; He tugged at the black nylon sweat suit he was wearing. As if the heat alone wasn&#x2019;t bad enough.<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe not, but I didn&#x2019;t come here to be slow-roasted.&#x201d;<br><br>He &nbsp;still &nbsp;didn&#x2019;t talk. &nbsp;He &nbsp;just &nbsp;looked at me. &nbsp;Dave &nbsp;Swinton, twenty-nine years old and &nbsp;already eight times champion steeplechase jockey. At five-foot-ten, he had a continuous struggle&nbsp;with his weight, that was common knowledge, but owners and trainers were often happy to accept a touch overweight in order to have his exceptional skill in the saddle. And for good reason&#x2014;the stats showed that he won almost a third of the races in which he rode.<br><br>&#x201c;Off the record?&#x201d; he said.<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be silly,&#x201d; I replied. I was an investigator for the British Horseracing Authority, the organization responsible for regulatory control of all Thoroughbred racing in the United Kingdom. Nothing I saw or heard to do with racing could be off the record.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll deny I said it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Said what?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been in this bloody oven now for over ten minutes and I&#x2019;m starting to look like a lobster. Either you tell me why I&#x2019;m here or I&#x2019;m gone.&#x201d; I wondered why he&#x2019;d been so insistent that we should talk in his &nbsp;sauna. &nbsp;I had thought it was &nbsp;because he &nbsp;needed &nbsp;to shed &nbsp;a pound or two before racing &nbsp;at &nbsp;Newbury &nbsp;that &nbsp;afternoon, &nbsp;but maybe it was actually to make sure that I had no recording equipment hidden about my person. As a rule, I used my iPhone to record meetings, but that was in the pocket of my jacket, which was &nbsp;hanging &nbsp;up on a &nbsp;peg outside, &nbsp;along &nbsp;with the &nbsp;rest of my clothes. Dave went on looking at me as if still undecided.<br><br>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m done.&#x201d; I stood up, wrapped the towel I had been sitting on around my waist and pushed open the sauna&#x2019;s wooden door.<br><br>&#x201c;I lost a race this week.&#x201d;<br><br>I put one foot through the doorway. &#x201c;So? You can&#x2019;t win them all.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said, shaking his head. &#x201c;I lost it on purpose.&#x201d;<br><br>I stopped and turned &nbsp;to him. I knew most of the Rules of Racing by heart. Rule (D)45.1 &nbsp;stated that a jockey was required, at all times, to have made a genuine attempt &nbsp;to obtain from his horse timely, real and substantial &nbsp;efforts to achieve the best possible placing. To lose a race on purpose was to willfully flout that rule, an offense that could carry a penalty of ten years&#x2019; disqualification from the sport.<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t answer. He simply went back to studying the space between his feet.<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; I asked him again. <br><br>&#x201c;Forget I ever said it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can hardly do that,&#x201d; I said. Winding back time wasn&#x2019;t possible. Just as &nbsp;uninventing the atom bomb wasn&#x2019;t ever going to happen. I looked down at him, but he went on scrutinizing the floor. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t we get out of this bloody heat and talk about this overa glass of iced beer?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t drink anything,&#x201d; he replied sharply without moving his head. &#x201c;Not even water. What the hell do you think I&#x2019;m doing this for? I&#x2019;ve got to lose two pounds to ride Integrated in the Hennessy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Won&#x2019;t you be dehydrated?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Usual state for me,&#x201d; he said, trying to produce &nbsp;a laugh. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been wasting every day since I was sixteen. I can&#x2019;t remember what a square meal looks like. Nor a beer. In fact, I haven&#x2019;t had a proper drink for years; alcohol contains far too many calories. Not that I miss it much, I don&#x2019;t like the taste.&#x201d; He laughed again, but just once. &#x201c;Why do I do it? you ask. That&#x2019;s a bloody good question.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>He stood up and we both went out of the wooden box into the coolness. I wondered how many people had &nbsp;a sauna in the corner of their garage, not that there wasn&#x2019;t still plenty of room for a couple of expensive cars as well, a silver Mercedes saloon and &nbsp;a dark green Jaguar XK sports coup�, both adorned with personalized license plates. Dave flicked off a big red switch next to the door. <br><br>&#x201c;It must cost a fortune &nbsp;to heat,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;I claim my electricity bill against tax as a business expense,&#x201d; he said, smiling. &#x201c;This sauna is a necessity for my job.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;How often do you use it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Every day. I used to go to the one in the local gym, but then they turned down the temperature&#x2014;something to do with health and safety.&#x201d;&nbsp;He peeled off the nylon sweat suit and stepped naked onto a scale.<br><br>&#x201c;What the hell is that?&#x201d; I said, pointing at an ugly purple-and- black ring on his back.<br><br>&#x201c;Something landed on me,&#x201d; he said with a smile. &#x201c;Hoofprint.&#x201d; He looked down at the scale.&#x201c;I&#x2019;m still too heavy,&#x201d; he said with a sigh. &nbsp;&#x201c;No lunch for me today, to go with my no breakfast.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But you surely have to eat. You need the energy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t afford to,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;According to his bloody owner, if I can&#x2019;t do a hundred &nbsp;and forty-four pounds stripped by two this afternoon, I don&#x2019;t get to ride Integrated, and he&#x2019;s one of the best young chasers in the country. He&#x2019;s incredibly well handicapped for the Hennessy, and if I don&#x2019;t ride him today and he wins, I can kiss good-bye to riding him anytime in the future&#x2014;maybe start kissing good-bye to my whole career.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>He &nbsp;could kiss &nbsp;good-bye &nbsp;to his &nbsp;career anyway &nbsp;if he&#x2019;d &nbsp;been purposely losing races.<br><br>&#x201c;Tell me about the race you didn&#x2019;t win,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;I need a shower,&#x201d; he replied, ignoring me and going into the house. <br><br>&#x201c;You can use the one in the guest bathroom, if you like. Top of the stairs on the right.&#x201d;He bounded up the stairs and disappeared into what I pre- sumed was his bedroom, closing the door firmly behind him.Not for the first time I wondered what I was doing here. <br><br>&#x201c;Come now, Jeff.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s what Dave had said intently downthe line when he&#x2019;d called me at ten to seven that morning. &#x201c;At once. I need to talk to you. Right now. It&#x2019;s vital.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t we talk on the phone?&#x201d; I&#x2019;d asked.<br><br>&#x201c;No. Absolutely not. Far too important. This has to be done face-to-face.&#x201d;<br><br>Dave Swinton was one of the very few members of the racing fraternity that I called a friend. Mostly, I avoided social contact with those I was supposed to police, but, two years previously, Dave and I had been stranded for twenty-four hours together by an unseasonal ice storm as we tried to return home to England after the Maryland Hunt Cup steeplechase north of Baltimore. He was there as a guest rider and I had been invited to oversee the introduction of a new &nbsp;drug-testing regimen for American steeplechase horses.We &nbsp;had ended &nbsp;up spending &nbsp;a &nbsp;freezing &nbsp;night in an upstate country hotel with no heat or light, the power lines having been brought down by the ice. We had passed the night huddled under blankets in front of a log fire, and we had talked. Hence, &nbsp;I&#x2019;d &nbsp;come when &nbsp;he&#x2019;d &nbsp;asked, &nbsp;giving up a &nbsp;precious Saturday-morning lie-in to catch an early train from Paddington &nbsp;to Hungerford and &nbsp;then a &nbsp;taxi &nbsp;to Dave&#x2019;s &nbsp;house &nbsp;just outside Lambourn. He had dropped a bit of a bombshell with his claim to have lost a race on purpose, but if he refused to elaborate, I&#x2019;d have made a wasted journey. I went into his kitchen and gratefully drank down two large glassfuls of water from the cold tap. And still I was thirsty. How Dave could drink nothing after a session in that sauna was beyond me. I followed Dave&#x2019;s directions to the guest bathroom &nbsp;and had a shower but still had to wait downstairs for more than twenty minutes before he reappeared dressed in a dark green polo shirt, blue jeans and running shoes, his standard work attire.Whereas most top jockeys still dressed in suit and tie to go to the races in order to impress the owners and trainers, Dave Swinton had long forgone such niceties. Nowadays, Royal Ascot and the Derby meeting apart, racing in general was a more &nbsp;casual affair, and the current &nbsp;champion jockey was the most casual of them all.<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to Newbury now,&#x201d; he said, picking up a carryall that was lying in the hallway. &#x201c;I want to run the course before the first.&#x201d;<br><br>I looked at my watch. It was coming up on ten o&#x2019;clock.&#x201c;I came by train and taxi,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Can you give me a lift?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Where to?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Newbury &nbsp;racetrack &nbsp;will &nbsp;be fine,&#x201d; &nbsp;I said. &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll watch theHennessy and then take the train back to London.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you drive like &nbsp;everyone else?&#x201d; &nbsp;he said, &nbsp;clearly irritated.&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve no car,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need one in the city. I&#x2019;ll come with you.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>He could hardly say no, but I could tell that he wasn&#x2019;t that happy. Whatever &nbsp;he had decided to tell me at seven o&#x2019;clock that morning, he had clearly changed his mind since, and half an hour of us together in his car was not on his agenda, friends or not.&#x201c;OK,&#x201d; he said grudgingly. &#x201c;Are you ready?&#x201d;<br><br>He drove the Jaguar at speed out of Lambourn up Hungerford Hill, the only sound being the roar of the car&#x2019;s powerful engine, but if he thought I wasn&#x2019;t going to say something, he was much mistaken.<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Tell me about the race you didn&#x2019;t win.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Please, Jeff. I told you to forget it.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Try.&#x201d; mHe drove on in silence past The Hare public house and on toward the M4 junction, overtaking a line of slower vehicles with ease.<br><br>&#x201c;Which race was it?&#x201d; I asked. He ignored me. We turned &nbsp;eastward, accelerating on to the freeway.&#x201c;Come on, Dave, you asked me to come all this way because you had something to tell me that couldn&#x2019;t be said on the phone. So here I am. Speak to me.&#x201d;<br><br>He concentrated hard on the road ahead and said nothing as the Jaguar&#x2019;s speedometer climbed rapidly past a hundred &nbsp;miles per hour.&#x201c;Are you in some sort of trouble?&#x201d; I asked, although he certainly would be if what he&#x2019;d told me were true.He eased up on the power and pulled over toward the left. For a nasty moment, I thought he was going to stop on the hard shoulder and chuck me out, but he didn&#x2019;t. He just drove sedately along in the inside lane at a mere &nbsp;eighty-five.<br><br>&#x201c;Jeff, can I speak to you off the record?&#x201d; he asked again. <br><br>&#x201c;You know I can&#x2019;t agree to that. This is my job.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s my bloody job that I&#x2019;m more worried about.&#x201d; We took the exit off the freeway at Newbury and I sat and waited quietly while he negotiated the traffic lights at the inter- section.<br><br>&#x201c;Look, I&#x2019;ll keep what you say confidential if I can,&#x201d; I said, encouraging him to go on. &#x201c;But no promises.&#x201d;&nbsp;He must know that I was obliged to report &nbsp;any breach of the rules to the BHA Disciplinary Committee. <br><br>He sighed deeply. &#x201c;I need your help.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Ask away.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m being blackmailed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who by?&#x201d; I asked as calmly as I could.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Someone who knows more than they should about my financial affairs.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And aren&#x2019;t your financial affairs in order?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, &nbsp;of course &nbsp;they are.&#x201d; &nbsp;He &nbsp;paused. &nbsp;&#x201c;But, &nbsp;you know, working out the bloody tax is complicated. Maybe I take a few shortcuts.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;By not declaring certain things?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, maybe. But why should I pay tax on gifts?&#x201d; It depended if the &#x201c;gifts&#x201d; were actually payments for services rendered.<br><br>&#x201c;How much were these gifts that you didn&#x2019;t declare?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not much,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Not compared to what I do declare.&#x201d; Dave &nbsp;Swinton &nbsp;was, &nbsp;by far, &nbsp;the &nbsp;highest-earning &nbsp;jockey in British racing. He was the public face of the sport, with a mass &nbsp;of endorsements and sponsorship deals. His was the image that stared out of the Racing Needs You! posters of a recent widespread campaign &nbsp;to encourage &nbsp;the &nbsp;young to give &nbsp;it a &nbsp;try. His &nbsp;ever- present green polo shirts had the distinctive swoosh logo of a top sports &nbsp;manufacturer embroidered &nbsp;on the left breast above &nbsp;his name and there were advertising badges sewn onto each sleeve. He &nbsp;certainly &nbsp;earned far more &nbsp;from commercial &nbsp;endorsements than he did from his riding.<br><br>&#x201c;How much?&#x201d; I asked again. <br><br>&#x201c;About two hundred.&#x201d;I laughed. &#x201c;But that&#x2019;s not enough to worry about. Just include it in your next return. No one could blackmail you over that, surely?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Two hundred thousand.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah.&#x201d; The laughter died in my throat.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah. But I declare more than a million.&#x201d; He paused &nbsp; as he overtook &nbsp;a line of traffic waiting at some lights, swerving across into the correct lane to turn left at the very last moment. &#x201c;And then some bastard calls me and tells me to lose a race or else he&#x2019;ll go to the tax authorities and spill the beans.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And you&#x2019;ve no idea who?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;None,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Otherwise, I&#x2019;d have killed him.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think that would be particularly helpful.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Maybe not, but it might make me feel better.&#x201d; He drove on in silence until we arrived at the racetrack. <br><br>&#x201c;Which race did you lose?&#x201d; I asked again as we turned intothe parking lot.<br><br>&#x201c;I had twenty-eight rides and ten winners last week, &nbsp;so I lost eighteen races.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t mess with me, Dave,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You know what I mean.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t reply. He pulled the Jaguar into a space in the jockeys&#x2019; parking area. <br><br>&#x201c;Do you want my advice?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Not really,&#x201d; he said, leaning his head down on the steering wheel.I gave it to him anyway. <br><br>&#x201c;Go to the revenue and tell them you made an error of omission on your tax return &nbsp;and you want to correct it. Pay the tax. That will be an end to it. I&#x2019;ll try and forget what you&#x2019;ve told me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And if I don&#x2019;t?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then you&#x2019;d be a fool. If someone has that information, they will use &nbsp;it. They may &nbsp;not go to the authorities &nbsp;directly, but they will use it nevertheless. Perhaps they will try and sell it to a newspaper. You&#x2019;d be right in the shit. Much better that you go to the tax man before they do.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But I shouldn&#x2019;t have to pay tax on gifts. It&#x2019;s not like they were earnings.&#x201d;<br><br>He sounded as &nbsp;if he was trying to convince himself rather than me.<br><br>&#x201c;Go and ask your accountant if you need to declare them.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Bloody accountants,&#x201d; he said, sitting back in the seat. &#x201c;Youdon&#x2019;t want to tell them anything if you don&#x2019;t want the tax man to know it. In spite of the fact that it&#x2019;s me that pays their bill, my lot seem to work exclusively for the government, always telling me I can&#x2019;t claim for all sorts of things I think are essential for my job.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Get a new &nbsp;firm, then. And do it now.&#x201d;And maybe, I thought, it was one of his accountant team who knew about his tax-return omission who was trying to make a bit of extra cash on the side.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;How much money did the blackmailer demand?&#x201d; I asked him as we walked toward the racetrack entrance.&#x201c;<br><br>That&#x2019;s what was odd,&#x201d; Dave said. &#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t ask for money, he just said that I mustn&#x2019;t win the race.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Which race?&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t answer.<br></p></p><h2>Biblical Creationism: What Each Book of the Bible Teaches About Creation and the Flood</h2><p><p>In <em>Biblical Creationism</em>, Henry Morris explores all the mentions of creation in the Bible to reveal the incompatibility of theistic evolution and progressive creationism. Many Christians believe "science" has proven evolution and label the biblical account of creation as allegory. With this Bible study resource, Morris exposes the inconsistency of this theory.</p> <ul> <li>Is the literal interpretation of creation a critical component in living the Christian life?</li> <li>Could it be foundational to our understanding of God, Jesus, and Redemption?</li> <li>Does creation impact every other doctrine in the Bible?</li> </ul> <p>In this brilliant Bible commentary, Morris courageously contends only one interpretation of creation is possible without creating hopeless contradictions within the Bible and undermining many of its other messages.</p> <p>Henry Morris, a professional scientist and Christian apologist, focuses on the biblical facts rather than science in this volume. With uncompromising confidence, he asserts, "the scientific data will correlate with Scripture because the same God who wrote the Word made the world."</p> <p>Defending the Bible's inerrancy requires a thorough knowledge of the creation, the grand beginning of life with God and evidence of His supernaturally powerful spoken Word. Morris invites you and your church to strengthen your faith in this thorough investigation of all God's Word says about creation. With these insights, you will be equipped to stand firmly against the vain imaginations presented as doctrine by Godless and God-diminishing worldviews. Your steadfast confidence in the Bible can change the eternity of generations!</p></p><p><p>A prolific and influential scholar known to believers and skeptics alike as "the father of modern creation science," Dr. Henry M. Morris truly was a man of science and a staunch man of God. He was even said to have set the terms of debate about evolution for the second half of the 20th century by one Pulitzer Prize-winning academician. Dr. Morris began his serious study of the Bible in the 1930s and authoring books in the 1940s, but it was his landmark work, co-authored with Dr. John Whitcomb, titled <em>The Genesis Flood</em> in 1961 that influenced generations to begin discovering the fallacies of evolution and the biblical truth of creation.</p> <p>With over 60 books, founding and leading the Institute for Creation Research (ICR), Dr. Morris' death in 2006 was a profound loss to millions.</p> <p>Dr. Morris created a thriving legacy that continues to equip many Christians to be able to defend the accuracy and authority of Scripture today. The new <em>Henry Morris Study Bible</em> and other resources that he developed remain essential sources of knowledge and understanding for believers.</p><p>The gospel without the assurance of a Creator-God has no foundation (Rev. 4:11, 14:6-7). This book will embolden those whose faith has been undermined by evolutionary dogma. It gives exegesis of all the more difficult sections, furnishes deep expository dividends, and yields rich spiritual insights. It should prove to be a classic for generations to come, should the Lord delay His coming, and will become a resource for pastors, teachers, and lay leaders throughout the Christian family.</p> --Henry Morris III - Eldest son of Henry Morris</p><h2>The Last Prairie: A Sandhills Journal</h2><p>The Nebraska Sandhills are the largest remaining relic of the majestic prairies that once extended from the Missouri River to the Rocky Mountains. This vast but fragile expanse comes to life in <i>The Last Prairie</i>, a collection of twenty essays by Stephen R. Jones ranging from fascinating descriptions of dancing prairie-chickens, courting fireflies, and the annual migratory flight of a half-million sandhill cranes to equally vivid accounts of trailblazing homesteaders, range wars, and devastating storms. <i>The Last Prairie</i> is both a paean and an elegy for a place where you can walk for miles through shoulder-high grass or sit on a hill for hours with only the cry of the curlew and the hiss of the wind for company&#x2014;a place Jones sought for decades and for whose survival he now fears. <p>The author's vast historical canvas lends a rare perspective and urgency to the book's discussion of recent efforts to save the Niobrara River from dams and developers. Jones speaks eloquently to such timeless themes as humanity's search for community and the ties that bind us with nature. Infused with quiet pathos and vibrant imagery, <i>The Last Prairie</i> is a triumph of the essayist's art.</p></p><p>Running 100 miles from north to south and 200 miles from east to west, the Sandhills make up about a quarter of the state of Nebraska and constitute the largest grass-stabilized dune field in the Western Hemisphere. Sparsely settled, the region has inspired a fine literature, numbering books by Jim Harrison, Mari Sandoz, and Merrill Gilfillan, among other writers.<p> Stephen Jones's <i>The Last Prairie</i> is a welcome, elegant addition to that library. An inspired blend of science, natural history, ethnography, and memoir, it recounts Jones's travels along the Niobrara River and deep into the heart of dune country--once the province of buffalo, cranes, and scattered bands of Pawnee and Cheyenne Native Americans, now the site of huge ranches and, as Jones notes, an army of white-tailed deer and other former denizens of wetland forests that edged out onto the plains with the disappearance of large predators. "When it comes to ecosystem disturbances," Jones notes, "the white-tailed deer are just the tip of the iceberg," and indeed the Sandhills are threatened at every turn by industrial agriculture and other manifestations of putative progress. Jones considers some of the programs that have been advanced to save the area, including the apparently ill-advised "Buffalo Commons" preserve that residents fear would make the region an unnatural zoo; he suggests instead a more modest prairie preserve that would attract tourists and provide new revenue for the region's residents, now dependent on ecologically destructive ranching.</p><p> But Jones's book is less a program for action than a literate, attractive celebration of a place unlike any other--a book that will inspire readers to go and have a look for themselves. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>""Recently I stood on a wind-sculpted ridge with a friend, a Native American holy man, admiring the surrounding countryside and reflecting on its hypnotic appeal. 'The Sandhills, ' he said, 'is the most sacred of all places. It's where our spirit goes to rest when we die.' As we stood there with the wind whipping through our hair and nothing visible but grass, water, and sky, I knew his words were true."--Stephen R. Jones <p>It is a region that has long captivated and inspired travelers, writers, and artists. Celebrated as one of the most visually stunning of American landscapes, it is the largest remaining relic of the majestic prairies that once extended from the Missouri River to the Rocky Mountains. Now this vast but fragile expanse known as the Nebraska Sandhills comes to life in an unforgettable collection of essays by naturalist and author Stephen R. Jones. </p><p>Evocative, insightful, and melancholy, the twenty essays in "The Last Prairie limn the essence of life in the Sandhills. Fascinating descriptions of dancing prairie-chickens, courting fireflies, and the annual migratory flight of a half-million sandhill cranes stand alongside equally vivid accounts of trailblazing homesteaders, range wars, and devastating storms. "The Last Prairie is both paean and elegy for a place where you can walk for miles through shoulder-high grass or sit on a hill for hours with only the cry of the curlew and the hiss of the wind for company--a place Jones sought for decades and for whose survival he now fears. </p><p>The author's vast historical canvas lends a rare perspective and urgency to the book's discussion of recent efforts to save the Niobrara River from dams and developers. And in depictingthe life of the Plains Indians, including the nature of their cosmology and their doomed resistance to the encroachments of white settlers, Jones speaks eloquently to such timeless themes as humanity's search for community and the ties that bind us with nature.

Vanna forms a friendship with a man named Jare, and they become involved in buying and selling a stimulant known to the Health Authority to be extremely dangerous: chili peppers. Then Jare comes across a strange religious cult in possession of the Core of the Sun, a chili so hot that it is rumored to cause hallucinations.

Andrew Lawless tried to remember that Bill Hatchard was simply worried, and rightly so. Drew was worried, too. It was precisely why he'd decided on the course of action he was about to take. He turned to look out his office windows. All of Austin was laid out before him, the lights of the buildings around him coming on as the sun set over the Colorado River. He could remember the first time he'd looked out these windows ten years before. It had been the first time he felt successful and knew everything he'd worked for would finally come to fruition. He'd known that he would find the three people responsible for his parents' deaths.<br><br> If only there hadn't turned out to be a fourth . . .<br><br> "I told you I wasn't sharing the information with anyone." He glanced at the clock. Only another half hour to wait. He'd set the meeting after hours in order to keep things quiet. Perhaps he should have had the meeting at his house, but he never knew when his brothers or sister and their spouses would show up. They were getting ready to celebrate Riley and Ellie's marriage with a blowout reception, and he didn't want to tip them off until his plan was firmly in place.<br><br> He could hear Hatch moving, and knew exactly where he would go. There was the sound of a cork popping. Naturally Hatch went for the expensive Scotch. "You're wrong about this."<br><br> "So you've said." About a million times since that terrible night when they'd discovered who the real villain was.<br><br> "Fine." Hatch's tone was short. "Explain it to me."<br><br> How could he get Hatch to understand? He turned and looked to the man who had been his mentor his entire adult life. "Mia's pregnant."<br><br> That should suffice. It made sense to Drew. Mia was pregnant, and that meant he kept his mouth shut.<br><br> Hatch frowned. "What does that have to do with anything? That was inevitable the way she goes at it with that cowboy of hers. A pregnancy makes things worse. Now she's even more vulnerable."<br><br> Hatch wasn't a sunny-side-of-life person, but then neither was Drew.<br><br> "Yes, she is, but I suspect she'll be safe enough. She's going to try her hand at fiction for a while instead of wandering the globe looking for trouble." His sister was a reporter and a ball of chaos. Rather like the woman he was about to meet. "Case and the rest of the Taggarts will look out for her."<br><br> "And the Taggarts would be invaluable in finding our target," Hatch insisted.<br><br> McKay-Taggart was the premier security and investigative company in the country. Drew knew he wouldn't have taken down Steven Castalano and Patricia Cain without them. But he couldn't hire them for this job, and Mia was the reason why. He couldn't ask family to put up walls, to risk relationships for his revenge.<br><br> "Do you know what Mia said to me when she told me she was having a baby?"<br><br> "Hopefully she said, 'Do everything in your power to ensure no one kills me or my baby because there's a psychotic bitch running around out there who wants to do just that,'" Hatch insisted. "If she didn't say that, then she missed the point."<br><br> "She told me she wished our mother was here. She told me she wished she could hold our mom's hand and ask for her advice. She cried because her mother is dead." It had ripped his heart out. He couldn't explain to her that the mother she longed for was alive and well and had killed at least five people.<br><br> The mother Mia missed had tried to kill them all.<br><br> Hatch came up beside him, holding out one of two crystal tumblers. "You don't want Mia to know that Iris is alive and posing as Francine Wells. I get that. It's no reason to cut out Taggart."<br><br> "Ian Taggart would feel the need to tell his brother." It was why he hadn't already brought the man in. "He would tell Case and inevitably Case would tell his wife, and Mia would find out. Once Mia knows, she'll start to research Iris herself."<br><br> He couldn't bring himself to call that woman mother. Not ever again.<br><br> "So tell her not to."<br><br> "Have you met my sister?"<br><br> Hatch knocked back his Scotch in one long swallow before turning dark eyes on Drew. "You can't allow Iris to walk around like nothing happened."<br><br> "I have no intention of doing that, but she was quite clear in her instructions to Carly. She told us to back off or she would finish what she started all those years ago." When she'd murdered their father and his apparent mistress, then locked all the doors and set the house on fire with her four children inside.<br><br> Was it any wonder he didn't want to tell Mia the truth? She needed to think about her baby. Riley and Bran needed to concentrate on the future and their partners.<br><br> He'd promised them they would be free after they'd taken down Stratton, Castalano, and Cain. He meant to honor that promise. He would handle Iris Lawless on his own.<br><br> "Do you honestly believe she'll leave them alone?"<br><br> He had to. "She has for years. Twenty, to be precise. And I believe she'll leave Mia alone for the simple fact that she married into a vengeful barbarian horde. She won't want to start a war with the Taggarts. She can't win that one."<br><br> "But you think she can beat you?"<br><br> "I don't intend to announce the fact that we're involved in a skirmish at all," he replied. "I've ensured that there are no records of that sketch in the police file. I've also investigated the police computer systems. There were no attempts to hack in before I scrubbed the file."<br><br> "But after?"<br><br> "I almost missed it," Drew admitted. "It was subtle, but someone downloaded the report the police made the night of Patricia Cain's overdose."<br><br> "She was murdered." Hatch could definitely state the obvious at times.<br><br> "I know that. You know that. The police in LA are calling it an accidental overdose."<br><br> Hatch shook his head. "Why won't they investigate?"<br><br> "Because I don't want them to. Because I wrote a large check to ensure that they don't." Oh, it wasn't anything so gauche as a bribe. It was simply the offer of a man grateful to the police for keeping his brother out of the limelight surrounding America's most famous style maker's rather scandalous death. It wasn't anything new to the Los Angeles PD. They'd been happy to ensure Bran's name had been kept out of the press and to quickly close the investigation. The tabloids had gone insane for a few days and then the reporters had moved on to different scandals.<br><br> All except one. And he intended to take care of her tonight.<br><br> Hatch swore under his breath. "I wondered about that. So if you're not going to allow her to get away with it and you're not going to use the police or your McKay-Taggart resources, I assume you're going to do this all by yourself."<br><br> "Not at all. I'm hiring an investigator, but one I can control." One he also wanted to get into bed with, but then that was all a part of his plan.<br><br> "Another agency?"<br><br> "No, an individual." There was a reason he hadn't gone over this with Hatch, but if all went well, in a few hours he would know anyway. There was zero chance of Hatch buying the story he was going to sell to his family.<br><br> "So you hired a private investigator? I hope he's also a bodyguard."<br><br> "I intend to ensure that she's discreet."<br><br> Hatch went still beside him. "She? You hired a female PI?"<br><br> "She's actually a reporter, but she's a brilliant investigator." After all, Shelby had realized something was seriously wrong with his parents' case long before Drew had. She'd requested medical records, started digging in a way that led him to believe she knew something she shouldn't. He'd stopped her at every turn, but only because he meant to control this investigation.<br><br> Shelby Gates would be allowed the keys to the kingdom, provided she was willing to sign the agreement he'd drawn up.<br><br> Then he would have her, and he would enjoy himself for as long as it lasted. Until the moment that she realized he was a manipulative asshole and walked away from him.<br><br> "Tell me it isn't that redhead from LA. The one you got a hard-on around every time she walked in the damn room." Hatch didn't wait to sigh impatiently or for confirmation. "Damn it, Andrew, I thought I taught you not to think with your dick."<br><br> Hatch had taught him many things. And then there were the lessons Drew hadn't needed. Like how to protect the things and people he held closest to his heart. From the moment he'd felt the heat of the fire against his skin, seen his parents' bodies and not been able to get to them, he knew that he was responsible for his siblings. He'd done a piss-poor job at times, but this move was all about protecting them.<br><br> "Shelby can get into places I can't. She's also innocuous. Most people don't see past her chest and hips and all that hair to the ambitious woman inside." He intended to use that ambition against her. "Once I teach her how to be perfectly discreet, she'll attract no attention to our family."<br><br> "So you're sending her out there like a sacrificial lamb," Hatch mused as though the idea didn't actually bother him. "She'll send you information, but if Iris comes after someone, it won't be our family."<br><br> Hatch was very much a member of the Lawless clan. The boozy, obnoxious, brilliant uncle who fucked up but was always loyal. Hatch had been loyal to Benedict, and that fealty had switched to Drew when he came of age. Once Drew had sobered Hatch up, he'd proven to still have the business acumen he'd shown when he ran his father's company. Hatch had applied it to 4L and they'd gone the distance. A few billion dollars later and they were still on top of the world.<br><br> And still had unfinished business.<br><br> "I don't intend to get the girl killed."<br><br> "But you're willing to put her in danger. You saw what happened to the last few people who even hinted at getting in Iris's way."<br><br> Yes, he'd heard what the woman had told Carly. As Bran had lain there bleeding, Carly had listened to a recitation of Francine Wells's crimes. Of course Carly hadn't realized she was actually talking to Iris Lawless, but she knew the woman who stood before her had poisoned Phillip Stratton before he could potentially tell all, killed Steven Castalano in his hospital bed the day before he was scheduled to talk to police, and sent someone in to murder Patricia Cain.<br><br> He was well aware of the risks his black widow mother posed. "Better her than my family, and she'll agree. She'll do whatever it takes."<br><br> "How can you be sure of that?"<br><br> "Because I've done a study on her." He knew all her data by heart, but he was intrigued at getting to know the real Shelby Gates. He wanted to see the woman inside the warrior goddess.<br><br> Did she fuck like she lived? Would she be a wildcat in bed, or sweet and soft after a man had given her everything he had? Would she curl up next to her lover and let him take care of her, let him adore her? Could he soften her with sex, with affection? Could he soften her so much that at the end she would consider forgiving him?<br><br> "So you think this woman is going to do your bidding because you offer her cash?" Hatch asked.<br><br> "Cash is the last thing I would offer her."<br><br> "All right. What are you offering her?"<br><br> Drew knew the way to Shelby's heart. "I'm offering her the story of a lifetime."<br><br> Hatch frowned his way. "I'm confused, Drew. First you say you're going to hide everything so Mia and the others never have to know what Iris has done. Now you're turning it into a bestseller."<br><br> "I'll give her the story. I'll even let her write it."<br><br> "But you won't let her publish it. You're going to let her put her neck on the line and then take it all away from her. Damn, Drew. That's cold. And it could work. You have her quietly find what you need. No one ever has to know you're involved at all."<br><br> "I thought about playing it that way, but I can't. I need to be able to keep an eye on her until I'm sure I have all the research, and I can't risk letting her tell this story. I'll stick close to her and, when the time is right, I'll take her notes, her research, and everything else." He didn't like how tight his tie suddenly felt. "And I'll offer her something in return. I'll get her any job in the world she could possibly want. She wants to work for the New York Times, I'll make it happen. She needs cash to set herself up as a freelancer, consider me her personal bankroll."<br><br> "And if all she wants is what you offered her in the first place?"<br><br> He shook his head. "She'll be reasonable in the end. She'll see that I can't allow my family secrets out in the open."<br><br> "So you're going to leave things the way they are? You're going to let everyone believe Benedict killed your mother and himself?"<br><br> "I don't know, damn it." He forced himself to calm down. Cool. Calm. That was the only way he managed to get anything done. "Like I said, the situation is rather fluid at the moment. What I need to do is figure out exactly where Iris is and what she's been doing for twenty years. My brothers and sister know our father was a victim. That might have to be enough."<br><br> "And if she's living it up somewhere? Are you going to ruin her life? You think that will solve your problem?"<br><br> "No. There's only one thing I want to do to Iris." He felt himself go infinitely cold. This was the real reason why he couldn't bring his siblings in. He knew how this would end. "I'm going to make sure she can never hurt us again. One way or another."<br><br> "All right. I'll stand by you," Hatch said, crossing the room and getting himself another drink. "How do you intend to keep an eye on Shelby?"<br><br> "I'm going to be her boyfriend."<br><br> Hatch sputtered. It was good to know his mentor could still be shocked. "What?"<br><br> "Part of the contract is that her cover for this assignment is as my girlfriend. It won't surprise anyone. Bran and Riley saw right through my reasonable annoyance to the illogical sexual reaction I have around that woman. And Mia and Carly tried to set me up with her. I'll simply explain that the last time I was in Los Angeles, I asked her out to dinner and we began seeing each other."

Come along for the ride as he recreates the dream for his little friend. How far will Hank fly? What will he see? How high will he go? These dreamland mysteries capture his friend's imagination and they will capture yours too. The enchanting images of Rebecca Dudley's meticulously crafted dioramas set the scene for this gentle fantasy. Readers will set sail, gliding through Hank's world as he discovers the wonders of flight and the magic of friendship. This gentle, uplifting fantasy by the author of the bestselling <b>Hank Finds an Egg</b> highlights the magic of friendship and lets young readers' imagination soar. Rebecca Dudley's highly praised, hand-crafted dioramas and characters -- combined with minimal text -- will entertain and delight.</p><p><b>Rebecca Dudley</b> is a builder, creator, photographer, and artist. She makes everything that appears in her illustrations -- the trees, leaves, streams, clouds, and the creatures themselves. She lives in Evanston, Illinois.'Last night I dreamed I flew!' announces Hank, the bear/monkeylike critter from <b>Hank Finds an Egg</b>, before proceeding to regale his hummingbird friend with a step-by-step recounting of his dream. Dudley again stages the action in carefully crafted and photographed dioramas, this time creating lovely parallels between the 'real' and dream action of the story. On the left side of each spread, Hank races through the forest, sits on a rope bridge, and swings from a tree. Each action mirrors events from his dream, which are shown in scenes that appear at right, with Hank floating over rivers and through the clouds in a delicate, translucent airship. Readers will find Hank's subconscious travels every bit as enticing as his forest wanderings. --Publishers Weekly Starred Review<br><br>As before, Dudley's images are awesome: delicate dioramas handmade from materials like clay, paper, wire, and fabric and then photographed with shallow focus to make them come popping to life. The tone is understated and sweet, and when the hummingbird asks to hear the entire dream again, Hank complies and adult readers should also be ready to accede to similar requests from their listeners. --American Library Association Booklist<br><br>''Meticulously crafted.'' --Kirkus<br><br>''It's a tribute to Hank, the stuffed animal photographed for this entrancing tale, that you don't pause to try to categorize him. Is he a monkey, a dog, a bear, or all three? It doesn't matter, because from the moment you set eyes on his lopsided hand-sewn face, he is strangely, magically, unmistakably alive. This kind of transformation occurs only occasionally in children's literature -- I was reminded of the 'Lonely Doll' books by Dare Wright -- and when you find it, you don't quibble about monkey noses and dog tails. Dudley, an artist who lives in Evanston, photographs Hank moving through a series of woodsy diorama scenes that are at once unapologetically make-believe and strikingly familiar. There are meticulously constructed prairies, creeks and oak trees; there's even a glimpse of what could be Lake Michigan. We first find Hank sleeping in a bed of leaves, his hummingbird friend perched in the tree above him, and then it's morning, and Hank is telling his pal about his dream ('I flew!'). In the panels that follow, Hank gives the bird an action-packed step-by-step account, with each real-world demonstration (Hank leans on a swing to show how he peered down at the ground) followed by a depiction of the same moment in the dream (Hank leans out of his flying machine, which is hovering above a grassy field). The gentle sweetness of this tale is undeniable; 'Hank,' which will be released October 15, is a great choice for bedtime reading. But older readers will also appreciate the book's quiet heft and complexity: the layer upon layer of make-believe, the shadows in the corners of bright landscapes, the poignancy of a very small creature venturing forth in a very big world.'' --Nara Schoenberg<br><br> --Chicago Tribune<br><br>''It's a tribute to Hank, the stuffed animal photographed for this entrancing tale, that you don't pause to try to categorize him.

A growing consensus of recent scholarship (including Martyn, Raymond E. Brown, Meeks)&nbsp;seeks the roots of this Gospel and its traditions in the conflict between Jesus' followers and opponents within Judaism. In their struggles, Jesus' followers are encouraged and strengthened by his continuing presence in the Spirit, which articulates his meaning for new situations. Although distinctive, Johannine Christianity does not develop in complete isolation from the broader Christian Gospels. Out of a fascinating, if complex, setting develops the strikingly unique statement of Christian faith, practice, and doctrine found in the Gospel of John.

She lives in Phoenix, Arizona.<b>CHAPTER ONE</b><br><br><b>WHAT IS NUMEROLOGY?</b><br><br>Looking for a new dimension? A channel to flawless timing? An appraiser of personal assets? If you can count your fingers effortlessly, you can use numerology to find your answers. Numerology is a mystical arithmetic system that reveals character, personality, and experience through the sensible progressions of numbers.<br><br>Numerology's simple arithmetic bases its startling revelations on over 11,000 years of coincidence. Prehistoric, ancient-Greek, and Elizabethan-Age societies all recognized its efficacy. Clan leaders, philosophers, and priests throughout the ages have organized its psychical information. Modernized in the sixth century B.c., today it is a down-to-earth, straightforward, speedy system for self-examination and charting opportunities.<br><br>Numerology elongates the vision of the nearsighted, blasts through tunnel vision, and just plain sheds light when we want clarity. Numbers are not just cumulative values to be totaled by a calculator or applied to odds at a crap table. This is the eighties, the age of numbers, and the duality of their importance is even more in focus. We are drawn to people, places, and things that vibe with us, and most of us find one or two numbers that feel lucky or seem to turn up in addresses or phone numbers no matter how often we change them. When you understand the gist of the number meanings, you will be able to understand the types of people and experiences that your changing home, phone, and auto repeatedly attract.<br><br>For those interested in metaphysics, numerology can sharpen mind-expansion techniques and prepare the mind to use extrasensory perceptions and mental transference easily. Numerology prods one to stretch the imagination. You may visualize how you look, feel, and act at your highest possible potential based on its number meanings. As the ancients knew and today's forecasters believe, whatever the mind can visualize, one can achieve.<br><br>Numerology provides a complete personality-lifestyle profile when we apply the meanings of individual numbers to our birth names and birth dates. The numbers of our names describe the things that we are born knowing. The numbers of our birth dates describe the things that we have to learn.<br><br>The number symbols for the letters in your name outline your natural instincts, self-image, and talents. People relate immediately to their names. Metaphysicians believe that the soul selects its name prior to birth to reflect the sound of its capacities. To the listener a name is the person's melody, and those who are soulmates respond favorably when it is spoken. Names attract or repel according to their vibrations. If you compared the name numbers of best friends and intimate lovers, you would find the same numbers in their numerology charts. Uncomfortable relationships will have name numbers that are not compatible. That's because, according to Pythagoras, the father of modern numerology, "like" numbers have an affinity for one another. Certain numbers that crop up in a person's life repeatedly -- in addresses, telephone listings, auto license plates, bank accounts, social security numbers -- originate in the numbers of their name or birth date.<br><br>The numbers in your birth date describe lifetime experiences and their objectives. The subdivisions of the birth date -- the month, day, and year numbers -- are symbols for three major cycles of life experiences, and the total number meaning explains the types of people and experiences you will meet along the way, otherwise known as your destiny.<br><br>The birth-month and birthday-number meanings describe attitudes and actions. The birth-month-number meaning describes youthful impressions and environments. The birthday number symbolizes experiences during the twenty-seven-year mid-life productivity cycle, including the period from approximately age twenty-eight to age thirty-six, when you mature and stabilize. The day-of-birth number can help during that time by putting a focus on your career and explaining options.<br><br>Then there is the challenge number. I believe this number, found through a subtraction of your birth-date numbers, is one of the most important numbers in a person's life because it describes how you will <i>cope</i> with your destiny. It tells how you will use your natural instincts and talents (symbolized by your birth-name number) and how you will deal with the people and experiences you meet (symbolized by your birth-date number). And, after all, it is not your <i>fate</i> but your <i>attitude</i> toward it that determines success or failure, happiness or misery.<br><br>According to psychologists and therapists who have listened to their clients' taped numerology counselings, the perceptions of the challenge-number meanings are accurate and usually prove to be valuable tools for growth. While the childhood training ground for what later becomes obsessive and compulsive behavior may take years to identify in therapy, with numerology it is simply a matter of subtracting the month, day, and year of birth numbers. After these patterns are identified, trained professionals can offer methods for behavior modification. Of course, knowledge of challenge-number meanings alone cannot change behavior. It takes desire and commitment, too. If the interpretation of your challenge number brings past mistakes to mind, it's up to you whether the experience sparks self-delusion or a new awakening. As always, you have a choice.<br><br>But while challenge numbers describe self-destructive attitudes, negative habits, angers, and frustrations, they can also be the key to revealing hidden talents and opportunities and can help point the way to success. Challenge patterns are deeply ingrained in us from childhood, and when we learn to balance their extremes, challenges can become major pluses. At their negative extreme these numerological "Freudian slips" describe think-stuck attitudes, inappropriate reactions, and unrealistic self-appraisals. But by identifying these unpleasant tendencies, challenges can trigger the desire to finally call a halt to black-and-white decision making, self-destructive behavior, and the mental, emotional, and physical problems they create.<br><br>When you use numerology as a companion to common sense, all things are possible. For people who will take all the help they can get, numerology can be a wonderful copemate. If you wish to explore the greater significance of character, to uncloak disturbing habits, and to gain a purposeful perspective, NUMEROLOGY HAS YOUR NUMBER.<br><br>Copyright � 1988 by Ellin Dodge</p><h2>Pattern Theory: Introduction and Perspectives on the Tracks of Christopher Alexander (pattern research series)</h2><p>This book &#x201c;Pattern Theory&#x201d; summarizes the work of an important contemporary thinker, the architect and systems theorist Christopher Alexander, an emeritus professor at the University of Berkeley, California. In 1979 one of his books, "A Pattern Language", an 1100-page-essay on architecture and human life, became a non-fiction best seller that attracted half a million readers and continues to inspire people from many disciplines. The still broader four-volume essay "The Nature of Order" was published 2002-2004 as magnum opus. The life work of Alexander is outstanding. He develops a general theory of living systems, a systems theory based on the concepts center, wholeness and transformation by using design patterns and pattern languages as parts of the method. There is a whole new cosmos of thinking with astonishing bandwidth: Alexander suggests a new scientific paradigm that stands in opposition to the traditional causal mechanistic paradigm of natural science &#x2013; and he offers a new knowledge format as a way to enable people and support their participation in design processes. Alexander's theories have already proven useful in education, organizational development, permaculture, and in software the design patterns have even become mainstream. Many disciplines are about to follow in this development. Pattern theory allows us to change our thinking, to rethink our world and to move towards a fairer society. This leads to more participation and higher sustainability. Alexander's concepts form a mental toolbox for societal change and innovation.</p><p></p><h2>Brain Body Diet: 40 Days to a Lean, Calm, Energized, and Happy Self</h2><p><p>The multiple <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author and Harvard-MIT educated women&#x2019;s health expert delivers a revolutionary 40-day program to reconnect the brain and body to prevent and reverse the myriad symptoms and diseases afflicting millions of women.<br><br>Do you struggle to lose weight or to fall and stay asleep at night? <br>Do you feel lethargic and a depressed? <br>Do you endure irregularity or other digestive problems? <br>Do you want to feel better and happier and to maximize your health and longevity?</p><p>Dr. Sara Gottfried has the answer.

Nearly forgotten in the war's massive overall death toll, some 50,000 aircrew would die in the&nbsp;combatant nations' fledgling air forces. <p>The romance of aviation had a remarkable grip on the public imagination, propaganda focusing on gallant air 'aces' who become national heroes. The reality was horribly different. <em>Marked for Death</em> debunks popular myth to explore the brutal truths of wartime aviation: of flimsy planes and unprotected pilots; of burning nineteen-year-olds falling screaming to their deaths; of pilots blinded by the&nbsp;entrails of their observers.</p><p>James Hamilton-Paterson also reveals how four years of war produced profound changes both in the aircraft themselves and in military attitudes and strategy. By 1918 it was widely accepted that&nbsp;domination of the air above the battlefield was crucial to military success, a realization that would change the nature of warfare forever.</p></p><p>James Hamilton-Paterson is the author of Empires of the Clouds, the classic account of the golden age of British aviation. He won a Whitbread Prize for his first novel, Gerontius. His most recent book was Marked for Death, a history of aerial combat during World War 1. He lives in Austria.&#x201c;<em>Marked for Death</em> tells its inherently vivid story with more sheer comprehensive energy than any previous English-language history has ever done. Hamilton-Paterson&#x2019;s book traces the rackety youth of human flight and its initially sloppy and largely undirected adaptation to the field of warfare, and his storytelling skills are on point and gratifyingly varied&#x2015;there isn&#x2019;t a dull page in this book.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Open Letters Monthly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Supremely readable.&nbsp;&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Washington Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The account is enlivened by quotes from pilots' journals and letters home. Best of all, the author&#x2015;who has a solid body of fiction to his credit&#x2015;is a consummate storyteller; not only does the book tell a fascinating story, it is nearly impossible to put down.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews (starred review)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Penned by one of Britain&#x2019;s most prolific and highly regarded authors, this book exhibits a clear, engaging prose so generously adorned with anecdotes and descriptive quotes that readers will want to keep on reading. This expertly written and nicely illustrated book is highly recommended.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Over the Front</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A terrific story, which Hamilton-Paterson tells with tremendous relish, elegance, and attention to detail. An acclaimed poet and novelist, he is excellent at capturing the sheer courage of the pilots who ran risks that almost defy credibility.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Sunday Times (London)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;An exhilarating book. By turns, thrilling, joyful, wistful, and provocative.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Rowland White</strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Marked for Death</em> is as interesting as it is scholarly.

Eighty-eight works of deep reflection, awe, and joy selected for this volume were created in his home and garden in Cap D'Antibes, France, overlooking the sparkling Mediterranean Sea.<br><br>Raffael's radiant vision of the natural world, including flowers, fish and water, has garnered critical praise throughout his long career. "Despite their iconic serenity when seen from a distance," wrote art critic Robert Hughes, "Raffael's paintings disclose a bejeweled profusion of incident close up," concluding that the artist's color-drenched canvases display "a tender virtuosity without parallel in other American figurative painting today."<br><br>It might be said that water, a symbol of life and constant change, is both Raffael's muse and teacher. The artist becomes its conduit as his colour-saturated brush glides along the surface of the white paper. "Watercolors have a mind of their own. I just need to show up and be present," he tells Betsy Dillard Stroud in her interview with the 81-year old artist.<br><br>Lanie Goodman, a fellow resident in the South of France, visits Raffael at work in his light- filled studio, which she describes, in her biographical profile of the artist, as his haven and heaven. With tables of brushes and glass dishes of paint, the carefully cultivated garden by his wife Lannis, and the blue sea beyond, Raffael joins the long legacy of artists - Cezanne, Matisse, Leger among them - nourished by this life and vista. <br><br>Raffael's home, where artist and nature are in constant dialogue, accounts for the artist's luminous painting, their symphonic color, and the splendour we behold in them. In his essay "A Walk in Beauty," David Pagel identifies Raphael's worlds within worlds as profound instances of big-picture thinking - the best possible experience of both Nature and Art.<br><br></p></p><p>Raffael is legendary among watercolorists...!

With the receipt in late 1778 of over 25,000 uniforms imported from France, much of the Continental army was uniformly clothed in blue or brown coats faced with red. This study by Marko Zlatich focuses on the systems used by state and Continental authorities to procure clothing materials from this point onwards, the quantities they obtained and the specifications of the uniforms themselves.

Angel Rama&#x2019;s groundbreaking study&#x2014;presented here in its first English translation&#x2014;provides an overview of the power of written discourse in the historical formation of Latin American societies, and highlights the central role of cities in deploying and reproducing that power. To impose order on a vast New World empire, the Iberian monarchs created carefully planned cities where institutional and legal powers were administered through a specialized cadre of elite men called <i>letrados;</i> it is the urban nexus of lettered culture and state power that Rama calls &#x201c;the lettered city.&#x201d; <br>Starting with the colonial period, Rama undertakes a historical analysis of the hegemonic influences of the written word. He explores the place of writing and urbanization in the imperial designs of the Iberian colonialists and views the city both as a rational order of signs representative of Enlightenment progress and as the site where the Old World is transformed&#x2014;according to detailed written instructions&#x2014;in the New. His analysis continues by recounting the social and political challenges faced by the <i>letrados </i>as their roles in society widened to include those of journalist, fiction writer, essayist, and political leader, and how those roles changed through the independence movements of the nineteenth century. The coming of the twentieth century, and especially the gradual emergence of a mass reading public, brought further challenges. Through a discussion of the currents and countercurrents in turn-of-the-century literary life, Rama shows how the city of letters was finally &#x201c;revolutionized.&#x201d;<br>Already crucial in setting the terms for debate concerning the complex relationships among intellectuals, national formations, and the state, this elegantly written and translated work will be read by Latin American scholars in a wide range of disciplines, and by students and scholars in the fields of anthropology, cultural geography, and postcolonial studies.</p><p>&#34;&#34;The Lettered City &#34;changed the ways in which historians, intellectuals and literary critics thought of the literary and cultural history of Latin America.&#34;--Walter Mignolo, Duke University<p>Angel Rama, one of Latin America&#x2019;s most distinguished twentieth-century men of letters, was a noted literary critic, journalist, editor, publisher, and educator.

Despite a savage attack that has scared the locals silent, Zen is determined to expose the truth. To make matters more complicated, a group of dangerous strangers, led by a rich, single-minded American have arrived to uncover another local mystery&#x2014;buried treasure&#x2014;and they will stop at nothing to achieve their goal. What ensues is a fiendishly suspenseful case that only Aurelio Zen could stumble into and only Michael Dibdin could have created: a wild thriller that takes us deep into a remote region of Italy and the darkest corners of human nature.</p><p>Michael Dibdin was born in England and raised in Northern Ireland. He attended Sussex University and the University of Alberta in Canada. He spent five years in Perugia, Italy, where he taught English at the local university. He went on to live in Oxford, England and Seattle, Washington. He was the author of eighteen novels, eleven of them in the popular Aurelio Zen series, including <i>Ratking</i>, which won the Crime Writers&#x2019; Association Gold Dagger, and <i>Cabal</i>, which was awarded the French Grand Prix du Roman Policier. His work has been translated into eighteen languages. He died in 2007.Chapter One<br><br>The dead man parked his car at the edge of the town, beside a crumbling wall marking the bounds of a rock-gashed wasteland of crippled oaks and dusty scrub whose ownership had been the subject of litigation for over three decades, and which had gradually turned into an unofficial rubbish tip for the local population. The arrival of the gleaming, silver-grey Lancia was noted by several pairs of eyes, and soon known to everyone in the town, but despite the fact that the luxury saloon was left unguarded and unlocked, no attempt was made to interfere with it, because the driver was a dead man.<br><br>The only ones to see him close to were three boys, aged between five and ten, who had been acting out a boar hunt in the dense shrubbery under the cliff face. The five-year-old, who was the prey, had just been captured and was about to be dispatched when a man appeared on the path just a few metres away. He was in his fifties or early sixties, of medium stature, with pale skin and a shock of hair that was profuse and solidly black. He wore a black suit of some cheap synthetic fabric, and a wide collar, almost clerical, but matte and black, encircled his neck. From it, beneath the throat, hung a large metal crucifix. The man's chest and feet were bare. He trudged silently up the steep path towards the old town, looking down at the ground in front of him, and showed no sign of having seen the trio of onlookers.<br><br>As soon as he was out of sight the two younger boys were all for following him, scared but daring each other not to be. Sabatino, the eldest, put paid to that idea with a single jerk of the head. No one had confided in him about this event, but the community in which they all lived was a plangent sounding board when it came to news that might affect its members. Sabatino hadn't heard the primary note that must have been struck somewhere, but he had unconsciously absorbed the secondary vibrations resonating in other parts of that complex instrument. 'Danger!' they had whispered. 'Lie low, keep away, know nothing.' Discarding his role as the renowned and fearless hunter of wild boar for that of the responsible senior child, he rounded up his friend Francesco and the other boy and led them down a side path back to the safety of the town.<br><br>The sole witness to what happened next was a figure surveyingthe scene through binoculars from a ridge about a kilometre away on the other side of the valley. The dead man followed the track until it rose above the last remaining trees and ceased to be a rough line of beaten earth and scruffy grass, to become a stony ramp hewn out of the cliff face and deeply rutted by the abrasive force of ancient iron-rimmed cart wheels. By now <i>il morto </i>was clearly suffering, but he struggled on, pausing frequently to gasp for breath before tackling another stretch of the scorched rock on which the soles of his feet left bloody imprints. Above his bare head, the sun hovered like a hawk in the cloudless sky.<br><br>The isolated hill he was climbing was almost circular and had been eroded down to the underlying volcanic core and then quarried for building materials, so that in appearance it was almost flat, as though sheared off with a saw. When the dead man finally reached level ground, he collapsed and remained still for some time. The scene around him was one of utter desolation. The vestiges of a fortified gateway, whose blocks of stone had been too large and stubborn to remove, survived at the brink of the precipice where the crude thoroughfare had entered the former town, but looking towards the centre the only structures remaining above ground level were the ruins of houses, a small church, and opposite it an imposing fragment of walling framing an ornate doorway approached by five marble steps. All around lay heaps of rubble with weeds and small bushes growing out of them. The rounded paving stones of the main street were still clearly visible, however, and the dead man followed them, moaning with pain, until the cobbles opened out into a small piazza.<br><br>He then proceeded to the church, bowing his head and crossing himself on the threshold. Ten minutes passed before he emerged. He stopped for a moment to stare up at the massive remnants of stone frontage which dominated the square, then crossed over to the set of steps leading up to the gaping doorway, knelt down and slowly crawled up the steps on his knees, one by one, until he reached the uppermost. A wild fig tree had established itself in the charred wasteland within the former dwelling, feeding on some hidden source of water far below. The dead man bent over it and kissed one of its leaves, then bowed down until his forehead touched the slightly elevated doorstep.<br><br>The man watching from the ridge opposite put down his binoculars,lifted what looked like a bulky mobile phone off the dashboard of the Jeep Grand Cherokee beside him, extended the long recessed antenna and then pressed a button on the fascia. The resulting sound echoed about the walls of the valley for some time, but might easily have been mistaken for distant thunder. A forkful of food stilled between the plate and his mouth, Zen sat watching the man at the next table. His gaunt, angular head looked as though it had been sculpted with a chainsaw from a knot-ridden baulk of lumber, but Zen was waiting for it to explode. Both men had ordered the <i>trattoria</i>'s dish of the day, but Zen's neighbour had then demanded <i>pepe</i>. This duly arrived, in the form of three fresh chilli peppers the size of rifle cartridges. He proceeded to chop them roughly and scatter the chunks over his pasta, seeds and all, before stirring the mass together and tucking in.<br><br>As so often since his transfer to Cosenza, Zen felt seriously foreign. He knew that if he had eaten even the smallest fragment of one of those peppers, he would have suffered not merely scorched taste-buds but also sweaty palpitations like those preceding a cardiac arrest, leaving him unable to eat, drink, talk or even think for at least fifteen minutes. His neighbour, on the other hand, chomped them down without the slightest change of expression. That grim countenance would never betray any emotion, but he appeared content with his lunch.<br><br>Zen toyed with his own food a bit longer, then pushed the plate away. Knobs of mutton knuckle protruded from the gloggy local pasta smothered in tomato sauce. Not for the first time, he asked himself how this bland yet cloying fruit had come to stand as the symbol of Italian cuisine worldwide, despite the fact that until a century or so ago very few Italians had even seen a tomato, never mind regarded them as a staple ingredient in every meal. As recently as his own childhood in Venice, they remained a rarity. His mother had never cooked them in her life. '<i>Roba del sud</i>,' she would have said dismissively, 'southern stuff.'<br><br>Which, of course, was the answer to Zen's question. The Spanish had introduced the tomato from their American empire to their dominions in southern Italy, where it grew like a weed. The historic waves of Italian emigrants from the south had virtually subsisted on this cheap and abundant foodstuff, whose appearance conveniently recalled the images of the Sacred Heart of Jesus which hung on their walls, and on the bottled sauce that could be made from it to last year round. They had adopted it as a symbol of their cultural heritage and identity and then sold it to the credulous foreigners among whom they lived as the very essence of Italian cuisine.<br><br>Zen signalled the waiter. Obsession was an occupational hazard in Calabria, but obsessing about tomatoes was absurd. He paid over the agreed fee and responded with a brief nod to the waiter's thanks, nicely pitched as always in the grey area between grudging respect and overt truculence. The moment he emerged from the air-conditioned dining room into the sullen, stacked heat of the street, he felt his pores gaping open like the mouth of the goldfish he had kept as a child. He lit a cigarette and surveyed the visible slice of sky, an incandescent azure enlivened by puffy, faintly bruised clouds trailing translucent spumes of virga. The door behind him opened and Nicodemo, the owner of the restaurant, appeared and also lit up.<br><br>'You didn't like your meal?' he asked with a solicitous expression.<br><br>Zen chose his words carefully.<br><br>'It was very authentic.'<br><br>Nicodemo beamed. He had already told Zen, at some length, that he was <i>un immigrante</i>. Having spent almost thirty years as a construction worker in a Canadian city called Tronno, he had now retired to his native Calabria and opened a restaurant dedicated to preserving and reviving the genuine cuisine of his youth.<br><br>'My mother used to make that dish on very special occasions, starting at dawn,' he confided to Zen in reverential tones. 'The sauce takes hours to prepare, but the flavour of sheep from the bone and the fat is incomparable.'<br><br>'There is certainly very little to which it can be compared. I just don't have much appetite today.'<br><br>'You're not unwell, <i>dottore</i>?'<br><br>'No, no. Overwork, I expect.'<br><br>Nicodemo nodded sagely. He wouldn't of course dream of prying further - one didn't interrogate the local police chief - but a sympathetic word never went amiss.<br><br>'Ah, this terrible business.'<br><br>A silence fell, which the restaurateur perhaps broke to avoid the appearance of any possible indiscretion on his part.<br><br>'And to think that he came here once to eat!'<br><br>'Did he like the food?' Zen replied, with a trace of sarcasm that was entirely lost on the other man.<br><br>'But of course! He too was rediscovering his heritage, just like me when I first returned.'<br><br>Zen hurled his cigarette into the gutter.<br><br>'I'm sorry, I thought you were referring to the American lawyer.'<br><br>'I am! As soon as I saw the picture on television I recognized him.'<br><br>'Signor Newman ate here?'<br><br>He sounded no more than politely interested.<br><br>'Only once. It had come on to rain suddenly. He sheltered in the doorway for a while, then came inside when it didn't stop. He asked my advice about what to order and after he'd eaten we got chatting. First in Italian, then in dialect. The rough stuff, from up in the Sila mountains. He hadn't spoken that for years, but it gradually came back to him. Like discovering that you can still ride a bicycle, he said.'<br><br>Nicodemo shook his head.<br><br>'He seemed delighted to be home again, just like me. And now this happens! Calabria can be harsh to her sons.'<br><br>He grasped Zen's arm lightly. Zen did not care to be touched by strangers, but had come to recognise this as an accepted rhetorical gesture in the south and managed to control his instinct to recoil.<br><br>'I really shouldn't ask this, <i>dottore</i>, but do you think he'll be all right?'<br><br>Zen freed his arm by making another of the rhetorical gestures used to punctuate lengthy discourses between men in the street, an activity as normal, frequent and essential to civic life in Cosenza as it had been in the Athenian agora.<br><br>'In such matters, nothing is certain. But the victim's son is due to arrive shortly, so with any luck we should be able to begin serious negotiations soon.'<br><br>Nicodemo nodded obsequiously and seized Zen's hand.<br><br>'Thank you, thank you! Perhaps I shouldn't have asked, but even though we only met briefly, I liked the man. Besides, he is a fellow immigrant.'<br><br>Zen turned away.<br><br>'You're coming tomorrow?' the restaurateur called after him. 'I'm serving spaghetti with clams.'<br><br>Zen paused, struck by the innocent recipe like a familiar face sighted in a crowd. This was a dish he had grown up with, the soft clitoral gristle of the clams in their gaping porcelain shells, the hard, clean pasta soaked in the subtle juice, a nudge of garlic, a dab of oil, a splash of wine . . .<br><br>'I'm going to the coast to buy the clams fresh off the boats first thing tomorrow,' Nicodemo added encouragingly.<br><br>'Will they be cooked in tomato sauce?' queried Zen.<br><br>'<i>Ma certo! </i>Just like my mamma used to make.'<br><br>Zen inclined his head respectfully.<br><br>'May she rest in peace.'<br><br>At the corner of the block, he stopped in a caf� to erase the lingering taste of tomatoes stewed in mutton grease by drinking two coffees and crunching down half a tub of Tic Tacs. He was just starting his second espresso when everything became strange. The light dimmed as in an eclipse of the sun, a wind entered through the open doorway, the pages of a newspaper lying abandoned on a table turned over one by one, as though by the hand of an invisible reader. Outside in the street, someone cried out jaggedly above the seething sound that had insinuated itself into the laden silence. A fusillade of ice pellets erupted upwards from the pavement and then the sky broke, dropping waves of sound that shook the ground and made the water in Zen's glass ripple lightly. Next the initial fusillade of hail turned to a hard rain and within moments the sewers were gorged. The water backed up, deluging the street where people caught in the storm held up briefcases or newspapers to protect their heads and gazed across at the lights of the caf� on the other bank of the impassable torrent, while those safe inside cackled and jeered, savouring their sanctuary.<br><br>And then it was all over. The rain ceased, the flood subsided and the sun came out. By the time Zen had paid and left, the streets were already steaming themselves dry. The accumulated odours from the clogged drains combined with the water vapour to create a pale miasmal veil through which he made his way back up the hill to the Questura.</p><h2>Healthful Cuisine</h2><p>If you&#39;re one of the millions of people who have learned about the superior health and nutritional benefits of raw and living food and want to begin experiencing its life-enhancing qualities, then &#39;Healthful Cuisine&#39; is for you.

When her ex-husband disappears, Thorn must use her only partially trained mage powers against the forces of Darkness. Outstanding supporting characters help compensate for a milieu with jarring inconsistencies (sugar is rare, but coffee and aspirin are common; no new computers have been built since most of humanity was wiped out, but the Internet is still an active source of commerce). The author's efforts to sex up the action with the concept of "mage-heat"&#x2014;mages are uncontrollably lusty around seraphs&#x2014;become tiresome, but the strong, cliffhanger of an ending bodes well for future adventures. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When originally published in 1978, Overhearing the Gospel introduced &#34;narrative preaching&#34; and forever changed the shape of contemporary preaching. Now a new generation of preachers can learn from the master himself in this revised and expanded edition of Craddock&#39;s groundbreaking method.</p><p>Called a "preaching genius" by CNN, <b> Fred Craddock</b> (1928-2015) was Bandy Distinguished Professor of Preaching and New Testament, emeritus, at Candler School of Theology, Emory University, and minister emeritus of Cherry Log Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). He was a sought-after lecturer, an author of several books, and a captivating storyteller.&#34;When this book first appeared three decades ago, it helped lead a major shift in homiletical thought and introduced the phrase &#39;inductive preaching&#39; into the language of American preaching. Much of the conversation and debate in preaching over the past generation was launched by this volume and the books that followed and engaged it. Now revised and with new sermons included, those who are serious about understanding the homiletical scene will want to take advantage of this opportunity to understand Craddock&#39;s contribution (and challenge) to our work.&#34;</p><h2>Teach Yourself Bluegrass Guitar</h2><p>(Music Sales America).

In doing so, it traces a tradition of love and reverence for Jesus that has characterized Islamic thought for more than a thousand years. An invaluable resource for the history of religions, the collection documents how one culture, that of Islam, assimilated the towering religious figure of another, that of Christianity. As such, it is a work of great significance for the understanding of both, and of profound implications for modern-day intersectarian relations and ecumenical dialogue.</p><p>Tarif Khalidi's introduction and commentaries place the sayings and stories in their historical context, showing how and why this "gospel" arose and the function it served within Muslim devotion. The Jesus that emerges here is a compelling figure of deep and life-giving spirituality. The sayings and stories, some 300 in number and arranged in chronological order, show us how the image of this Jesus evolved throughout a millennium of Islamic history.</p></p><p>Tarif Khalidi is Sheikh Zayed Chair in Islamic and Arabic Studies at the American University of Beirut. He is the author of numerous books, including <i>Classical Arab Islam: The Culture and Heritage of the Golden Age</i> and <i>Arabic Historical Thought in the Classical Period</i>.Tarif Khalidi's commentary and compilation of Muslim depictions of Jesus is a remarkable, eye-opening work of deep scholarship, profound religious understanding, and unprecedentedly rich cross-cultural exchange. A work as full of novelty as it is of wonderful illumination, Khalidi's effort to show how one major religion adopted and loved the central figure of another religion establishes him as one of the foremost Islamic scholars of our time. This book is a pleasure to read, accessible to generalists and to those for whom bellicose claims about the clash of civilizations are as unsatisfactory as they are false. (Edward W. Said, author of <i>Reflections on Exile and Other Essays</i>)<br><br>The 300-odd logia are enormously impressive, reminiscent of the Nag Hammadi corpus as well as of the Gospels, especially the Sermon on the Mount, yet altogether distinctive. The combination of sublime moralist and magician is striking, and so is the virtual exclusion of reference to the Crucifixion. The author's introduction makes the general history easily intelligible. (Frank Kermode, author of <i>Shakespeare's Language</i>)<br><br>Despite the stereotypes and ignorance that have sometimes marred it, the long relationship between Christians and Muslims has also been mutually appreciative and productive. Both traditions have, for centuries, shared a love for the prophet of Galilee. Now for the first time we have <i>The Muslim Jesus</i>, a previously uncollected compendium of stories and sayings of Jesus from Muslim sources, some of them over a millennium old. This invaluable classroom resource will also enrich the present lively dialogue between the two fraternal faiths. (Harvey Cox, author of <i>The Secular City</i> and <i>Fire from Heaven</i>)<br><br>Ascetic saint, lord of nature, miracle worker, healer, social and ethical model: such is the figure of Jesus in Professor Khalidi's 'Muslim gospel.' A figure of universal reach and resonance, the object of a ubiquitous and all-too-human religious sentiment unfettered by sectarian affiliation, the Jesus of Muslim penitential and sententious literature assembled by Tarif Khalidi is particularly salutary today. (Aziz Al-Azmeh, Zayed Professor of Islamic Studies at the American University of Beirut and author of <i>Muslim Kingship: Power and the sacred in Muslim, Christian, and Pagan Polities</i>)<br><br>Jesus figures prominently in Islam. Alongside the <i>hadiths</i>, the stories of the Prophet's sayings and actions, appear stories of Jesus' sayings and actions, 303 of which Tarif Khalidi has collected and translated to produce, for the first time, a Muslim gospel. Some of the sayings reflect certain of Jesus' sayings in the Christian gospels, while others probably derive from pre-Islamic ascetics and heroes...Khalidi's efforts bring a...[great] diversity of Muslim beliefs about Jesus into the book. To each story, Khalidi appends astute analysis, and a lengthy general introduction provides a historical and functional overview of the Muslim understanding of Jesus. An unique and important addition to the corpus of writings about Jesus. (John Green <i>Booklist</i> 2001-04-15)<br><br>Tarif Khalidi brings together Islamic primary sources about Jesus from the eighth to eighteenth centuries. Included are mystical works, historical texts about prophets and saints and, of course, the foundational words about Jesus in the Qur&#x2019;an...the literary quality of the texts and the role &#x2018;the Muslim Jesus&#x2019; has played in both Muslim piety and Muslim&#x2013;Christian relations. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2001-04-23)<br><br>[<i>The Muslim Jesus</i>] helps dispel the ignorance among Christians about Islam. It is a collection of Islamic sayings about Jesus in the Koran and Islamic literature...With a little perseverance, the reader is rewarded with a better understanding of Islam, and an appreciation of how one of the most central figures in Western civilization--Jesus of Nazareth--is perceived by another tradition. (Larry B. Stammer <i>Los Angeles Times</i> 2001-05-26)<br><br>Jesus captivated the Muslim imagination; in Islam, he is regarded as the last great prophet to precede Muhammad. Khalidi reminds us of the Middle Eastern milieu into which Islam arrived. Under a blazing desert sun, many of the world's great traditions--Judaism, Christianity, Zoroastrianism--mingled in a vibrant, dynamic atmosphere. The proximity of so many religions bred, along with tolerance, unmistakable signs of each other's influence...For many years, Khalidi engaged in scholarly archeology, poring over the Hadith for any sightings of Jesus. In <i>The Muslim Jesus</i>, he presents more than 300 stories and sayings...Consider one interesting East-West parallel aided by the book's chronological format. In a 14th century collection by the lawmaker al-Subki, Jesus is still a cherished figure, instructing Muslims that 'the rich shall not enter the kingdom of Heaven.' About the same time, Dante consigned Muhammad to cruel suffering in 'Inferno.' We might explain such drastically different treatments by the fact that imperial Islam was flourishing while Western civilization was in turmoil. Today, with the situation reversed, the value of <i>The Muslim Jesus</i> is all the more evident. 'Amid the current tensions between Christianity and Islam,' Khalidi writes, 'it is salutary to remind ourselves of an age and a tradition when Christianity and Islam were more open to each other, more aware of and reliant on each other's wishes.' (Nick Owchar <i>Los Angeles Times</i> 2001-10-20)<br><br><i>The Muslim Jesus</i> is as fascinating as it is timely. The sayings are remarkable and often beautiful literary artifacts in their own right; but more importantly, they demonstrate that the links that bind Christianity and Islam are much deeper, more complex, and far more intricately woven, that most of us would expect...Now of all times, it should be welcomed as a book of the greatest importance. (William Dalrymple <i>The Guardian</i> 2001-12-22)<br><br>Khalidi's long introduction is a gem of graceful erudition and analytical wisdom, setting the stage for dozens of often surprising and always fascinating extracts which show all the numerous ways in which Muslims, while denying both Incarnation and Crucifixion, nevertheless have a deep-seated affection and reverence for Jesus.

Said <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> 2001-12-07)</p><h2>Indian Boyhood (Native American)</h2><p>Charles Eastman, or Hakadah, as his Sioux relatives and fellow tribesmen knew him, as a full-blooded Indian boy learned the reticent manners and stoical ways of patience and bravery expected of every young warrior in the 1870's and 1880's. The hunts, games, and ceremonies of his native tribe were all he knew of life until his father, who had spent time with the white man, came to find him.<br><i>Indian Boyhood</i> is Eastman's first-hand reminiscence of the life he led until he was fifteen with the nomadic Sioux. Left motherless at birth, he tells how his grandmother saved him from relatives who offered to care for him "until he died." It was that grandmother who sang him the traditional Indian lullabies which are meant to cultivate bravery in all male babies, who taught him not to cry at night (for fear of revealing the whereabouts of the Sioux camp to hostile tribes), and who first explained to him some of the skills he would need to survive as an adult in the wilds. Eastman remembers the uncle who taught him the skills of the hunt and the war-path, and how his day began at first light, when his uncle would startle him from sleep with a terrifying whoop, in response to which the young boy was expected to jump fully alert to his feet, and rush outside, bow in hand, returning the yell that had just awakened him. Yet all Indian life did not consist in training and discipline. In time of abundance and even in famine, Indian children had much time for sport and games of combat &#x2014; races, lacrosse, and wrestling were all familiar to Eastman and his childhood friends.<br>Here too are observations about Indian character, social custom, and morality. Eastman describes the traditional arrangements by which the tribe governed itself &#x2014; its appointed police force, hunting and warrior scouts, and its tribal council, and how the tribe supported these officers with a kind of taxation. Eastman also includes family and tribal legends of adventure, bravery, and nature that he heard in the lodge of Smoky Day, the tribe historian. But Eastman's own memories of attacks by hostile tribes, flights from the white man's armies, and the dangers of the hunt rival the old legends in capturing a vision of life now long lost.</p><p>At the beginning of Indian boyhood Eastman recalls the 1862 Sioux Uprising in Minnesota that sent his family into exile in Canada. He describes his childhood there, which ended when his father, who had been presumed dead, appeared to take him back to the United States.About The Author Minnesota-born author Dr. Charles Eastman (1848-1939), also named &#x201c;Ohiyesa&#x201d;, helped found the Boy Scouts of America.

Lyons, August 7, 1957.<br><br>Between 1942 and 1944, nearly four hundred Marines virtually vanished in the jungles, seas, and skies of Guadalcanal. They were the victims of enemy ambushes and friendly fire, hard fighting and poor planning, their deaths witnessed by dozens or not at all. They were buried in field graves, in cemeteries as unknowns, or left where they fell. They were classified as &#x201c;missing,&#x201d; as &#x201c;not recovered,&#x201d; as &#x201c;presumed dead.&#x201d; And in the years that followed, their families wondered at their fates and how an administrative decision could close the book on sons, brothers, and husbands without healing the wounds left by their absence.<br><br>&#x2018;Leaving Mac Behind&#x2019; reconstructs the lives, last moments, and legacies of some of these men.

As she prepared for her journey, her uncle, sixty years after he'd left Lithuania in a boxcar, made a shocking disclosure about his wartime experience, and an elderly man from her ancestral town made an unsettling request. Gradually, what had begun as a personal journey broadened into a larger exploration of how the people of this country, Jews and non-Jews alike, are confronting their past in order to move forward into the future. How does a nation--how do successor generations, moral beings--overcome a bloody past? How do we judge the bystanders, collaborators, perpetrators, rescuers, and ourselves?

Celebrated for his incisive satires, most famously "The Rape of the Lock" and "The Dunciad," and for his philosophical verse, including the monumental "An Essay on Man," Pope united irony and wit with deep insight into human nature. His moral vision clothed itself in unparalleled technical excellence; Pope perfected the form of the heroic couplet and gave us a translation of Homer that is a lasting work of art in its own right.

Without meaning to diminish this wonderful and inventive work, it's possibly more accurate to describe it as a series of interlocking stories rather than a novel. At its center is Amelia Lovett, a na�ve, sensitive girl who matures, although never losing her youthful incredulity, as the book progresses. Her often tragic life story is recounted through an array of characters, vernacular voices, and episodes that with mordant humour track the sheer brutality of the era. Burns unflinchingly portrays the casualness, even banality, of the violence. The 9-year-old Amelia easily drifts from collecting buttons to plastic bullets; teenage girls shoot each other in the playground; wayward youths are kneecapped, and even a walk home from a disco can result in a "protracted, grisly and truly awful end." <p> What Burns manages to capture, through comic exaggeration, is a real sense of how fragile the boundaries of normality are. The sectarian killings are matched by equally senseless domestic feuds and conflicts. Amelia's mother's observation that "she could see that beating the crap out of her sister was one thing; kicking an IRA man to death or nearly was another" offers a measure of just how distorted their values have become. Amelia reacts to the madness around her by internalizing the violence, choosing to harm herself rather than others: first by becoming an anorexic and then an alcoholic. Burns has produced a compassionate, bitterly acute, witty portrait of the darkest days of Northern Ireland's history. <i>No Bones</i> could well emerge as Belfast's <i>Dubliners</i>. <i>--Travis Elborough, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Anna Burns, born in Belfast in 1962, is the author of No Bones, Little Constructions, and Milkman, winner of the Man Booker Prize.</p><h2>Quilts Make a Family (A Harriet Truman/Loose Threads Mystery)</h2><p>It seemed like a simple project&#x2014;make quilts for foster kids getting close to aging out of the system and teach them some useful skills as well. Granted, the foster parents aren&#x2019;t the most pleasant people, but Luke and Sincere and the others have already had tough lives and say they can handle it. Things get complicated, though, when a reality-TV show gets permission to film the kids and track down their relatives. Foster parent Paul Holloway is murdered, and the &#x201c;relatives&#x201d; the TV crew introduces are more than odd. Then, when the producer&#x2019;s assistant is killed, too, it&#x2019;s clear there&#x2019;s some deadly going on&#x2014;and the kids are the targets.</p><p>After working nearly 30 years in the high-tech industry, where her writing consisted of performance reviews, process specs, and a scintillating proprietary tome on electronics assembly, Arlene Sachitano wrote her first mystery novel: Chip and Die. Quilt As Desired, the first Harriet Truman/Loose Threads Mystery was published in the fall of 2003 and has been followed by ten more adventures. She also has a sequel to Chip and Die titled Widowmaker. Arlene is aided in her writing endeavors by her canine companion Navarre. When not writing, she is on the board of directors of the Harriet Vane Chapter of Sisters In Crime as well as Latimer Quilt and Textile Center in Tillamook, Oregon.

More, a noted humanist whose friendship with Erasmus and authorship of <i>Utopia</i> earned him great fame in Europe, succeeded Cardinal Wolsey as Lord Chancellor of London at the time of the English Reformation. In 1535, More was martyred for his refusal to support Henry VIII's divorce and break with Rome. Ackroyd's biography is a masterpiece in several senses. Perhaps most importantly, he corrects the mistaken impression that Robert Bolt's <i>A Man for All Seasons</i> has given two generations of theater and film audiences: More was not, as Bolt's drama would have us believe, a civil disobedient who put his conscience above the law. Ackroyd explains that "conscience was not for More an individual matter." Instead, it was derived from "the laws of God and of reason." If the greatest justice in this book is analytic, however, its greatest joys are descriptive. Ackroyd brings 16th-century London to life for his readers--an exotic world where all of life is enveloped by the church: "As the young More made his way along the lanes and thoroughfares, there was the continual sound of bells." --<i>Michael Joseph Gross</i>Thomas More&#39;s Utopia is one of the supreme achievements of Renaissance humanism.

She published eleven volumes of poems during her lifetime.When the world loses a major writer, there is a profound sense of finality; there will be nothing new of this creative energy to discover. But not in Swenson's case. The incredibly prolific Swenson, winner of the Rockefeller, Guggenheim, and Ford fellowships and many other literary honors, died in 1989 at the age of 76. Now, five years later, we have a new collection of her poetry that brings together poems from several earlier books, as well as poems published only in magazines, and introduces us to nine splendid poems published here for the first time. This collection, with a thoughtful foreword by Susan Mitchell, is brought together with special attention to poems describing the environment; poems of tides and the sea, of birds and gardens, of moods and seasons, of self and others. These are poems of keen observation; Swenson is an intensely present poet, fully in the moment. Writing of falling snow in one of the newly published poems, Swenson is immediate, gentle, lyrical: "There sprouts a mat/of white grass. Tips of pickets on the fence/get mittens." This is a collection to be treasured; it belongs in all libraries with even a modest selection of poetry.<br><i>Judy Clarence, California State Univ.

For over a century the suit has dominated wardrobes, its simple form making it the go-to attire for boardrooms, churches, or cocktail bars&#x2014;anywhere one wants to make an impression. But this ubiquity has allowed us to take the suit&#x2019;s history for granted, and its complex construction, symbolic power, and many shifting meanings have been lost to all but the most devout sartorialists.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> In <i>The Suit</i>, Christopher Breward unstitches the story of our most familiar garment. He shows how its emergence at the end of the seventeenth century reflects important political rivalries and the rise of modern democratic society. He follows the development of technologies in the textile industry and shows how they converge on the suit as an ideal template of modern fashion, which he follows across the globe&#x2014;to South and East Asia especially&#x2014;where the suit became an icon of Western civilization. The quintessential emblem of conformity and the status quo, the suit ironically became, as Breward unveils, the perfect vehicle for artists, musicians, and social revolutionaries to symbolically undermine hegemonic culture, twisting and tearing the suit into political statements. Looking at the suit&#x2019;s adoption by women, Breward goes on to discuss the ways it signals and engages gender. He closes by looking at the suit&#x2019;s apparent decline&#x2014;woe the tyranny of business casual!&#x2014;and questioning its survival in the twenty-first century.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Beautifully illustrated and written with the authority a Zegna or Armani itself commands, <i>The Suit</i> offers new perspectives on this familiar&#x2014;yet special&#x2014;garment. &nbsp;</p><p><b>Christopher Breward </b>is principal of Edinburgh College of Art and professor of cultural history at the University of Edinburgh.

This first English translation of a series of twelve essays known as <i>Alterity and Transcendence</i> offers a unique glimpse of Levinas defining his own place in the history of philosophy. Published by a mature thinker between 1967 and 1989, these works exhibit a refreshingly accessible perspective that seasoned admirers and newcomers will appreciate.<br><br>In today's world, where religious conceptions of exalted higher powers are constantly called into question by theoretical investigation and by the powerful influence of science and technology on our understanding of the universe, has the notion of transcendence been stripped of its significance? In Levinas's incisive model, transcendence is indeed alive&#x2015;not in any notion of our relationship to a mysterious, sacred realm but in the idea of our worldly, subjective relationships to others.<br><br>Without presupposing an intimate knowledge of the history of philosophy, Levinas explores the ways in which Plotinus, Descartes, Husserl, and Heidegger have encountered the question of transcendence. In discourses on the concepts of totality and infinity, he locates his own thinking in the context of pre-Socratic philosophers, Aristotle, Leibniz, Spinoza, Kant, and Descartes. Always centering his discussions on the idea of interpersonal relations as the basis of transcendence, Levinas reflects on the rights of individuals (and how they are inextricably linked to those of others), the concept of peace, and the dialogic nature of philosophy. Finally, in interviews conducted by Christian Chabanis and Angelo Bianchi, Levinas responds to key questions not directly addressed in his writings. Throughout, <i>Alterity and Transcendence</i> reveals a commitment to ethics as first philosophy&#x2015;obliging modern thinkers to investigate not merely the true but the good.</p><p>This first English translation of a series of twelve essays offers a unique glimpse of Levinas defining his own place in the history of philosophy.

Maier succeeds brilliantly here in bringing this outrageous, long-hidden (if rumored) bit of history to vivid and fact-supported life." &#x2014;<i>Booklist </i>(starred review).&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Just when you think you&#x2019;ve read and heard everything there is to know about the CIA, JFK, and the mob, along comes Thomas Maier with this meticulously researched and nuanced report that sets the record straight in some areas and breaks new ground in others. <i>Mafia Spies</i> reads like a thriller but it&#x2019;s all true. I found it gripping from page one. And important. The events reported on here changed history and give us better understanding of current times.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Michael Connelly, #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>Mafia Spies</i> is one of those stories that is truly more amazing than fiction, about an unlikely alliance between America&#x2019;s best and worst.&nbsp; The tale is told at a relentless pace and makes great reading.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Scott Turow, bestselling author of <i>Presumed Innocent</i>, <i>The Burden of Proof</i>, <i>Identical</i>, <i>Innocent </i>and more<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>Mafia Spies</i> brings history to life in epic, page-turning fashion. The depth of Thomas Maier's research is astounding, as are the famous characters and fantastical events that quietly changed US history."<br> &#x2014;Martin Dugard, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling co-author of <i>Killing Lincoln, Killing Kennedy, Killing Jesus</i>, and others written with television personality Bill O'Reilly<br> &nbsp;<br> "From CIA secret labs creating assassination tools first dreamed up by Ian Fleming in his James Bond novels, to poisoned cigars, exploding cats, Frank Sinatra, and two of the most well-connected mafioso in gangland history, Thomas Maier&#x2019;s <i>Mafia Spies</i> is a revealing look into one of the most outrageous spy tales of the twentieth century. If you are unfamiliar with Sam Giancana and Johnny Roselli, and their connection to everyone from low-life mob hucksters to JFK, this is a book that will open your eyes to a world of political intrigue that reaches into the depths and heights of mid-twentieth century American culture. Maier&#x2019;s knowledge of politics and of gangland lore is impressive, and he uses it here to great effect in <i>Mafia Spies</i>, a work that reads like a novel but is, amazingly, a nonfiction tale of mobsters working for the CIA to assassinate Fidel Castro. If Mario Puzo were more interested in journalism than fiction, this unrelenting page turner is the book he would have written instead of <i>The Godfather</i>.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Ed Falco, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Family Corleone</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The United States doesn&#x2019;t order foreign leaders killed. Unless it does. And it did in 1960 when the CIA took the unthinkable step of recruiting two Mafiosi&#x2014;Sam Giancana and John &#x2018;Handsome Johnny&#x2019; Roselli&#x2014;to murder Cuban Premiere Fidel Castro. The existence of this misbegotten plot was exposed in the 1970s during Senate hearings after the assassination of JFK, but we&#x2019;ve been denied a full accounting until now. Drawing upon documents recently released by the National Archives, Thomas Maier spins a vigorously picaresque tale of the hoodlums and their handlers as they make run after failed run at the Cuban premiere with such lunatic ploys as exploding cigars and contaminated scuba gear. Castro&#x2019;s crack intelligence network in Miami allowed him to dodge every bullet. The strength of Maier&#x2019;s account is that he delivers such richly detailed profiles of the players that they seem to unfold in three dimensions. Often frightening, at times hilarious, this is a cautionary tale for anyone thinking it might be a good idea to &#x2018;outsource&#x2019; intelligence operations. <i>Mafia Spies</i> is a bracing read and I enjoyed it thoroughly.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Teresa Carpenter, Pulitzer Prize winner and author of four books, including<i> Mob Girl: A Woman's Life in the Underworld</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This story exposes a dark chapter in America&#x2019;s history, when the CIA teamed up with murderous Mafia hitmen in an ill-fated assassination plot.

Thomas Maier&#x2019;s swashbuckling story-telling takes you into a clandestine, paradoxical world where gangsters were patriots, spies were hapless bureaucrats, and political deception and murder were the prevailing currencies. For those who study US foreign and domestic intelligence practices during the second half of the last century, this is a must-read.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Libby Fischer Hellmann, author of <i>High Crimes</i> and <i>Havana Lost</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>Mafia Spies</i> shows how the CIA and the Mafia colluded in a wild 1960s scheme to kill Fidel Castro, covered it up for years, and eventually paid an awful price. Investigative reporter Thomas Maier reveals many new aspects of America's most extensive and shocking spy scandal. As a real-life drama, this non-fiction book blends the mob violence and intrigue of <i>The Godfather</i> with the CIA thriller-like quality of TV's <i>Homeland</i>.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Gerard Ryle, director of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, 2017 Pulitzer Prize winner, &#x201c;The Panama Papers&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This is Thomas Maier&#x2019;s epic story of the CIA and the mobsters recruited to assassinate Fidel Castro in the 1960s. Maier&#x2019;s spotlight sweeps across America, casting its sharp focus from Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack to the lesser stars and starlets of Hollywood to Havana and finally to the White House itself. Maier&#x2019;s prodigious storytelling ability recreates a shocking moment in US history with unprecedented detail and drama, from the bungled attempt to assassinate Fidel Castro to the real possibility that John Kennedy himself was caught in the same seedy web.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Peter Eisner, author of <i>MacArthur&#x2019;s Spies</i>, former <i>Washington Post</i> deputy foreign editor, and co-author of <i>The Shadow President</i></p><h2>The Complete Best of Bridge Cookbooks Volume One</h2><p><p> <i>Bestselling cookbooks with more than 3,200,000 copies in print.</i> </p><p> Now available for the first time in one collectable and comprehensive volume, all the recipes from the first two books originally published by Best of Bridge Publishing Ltd.

This spur-of-the-moment notion was the impetus for The Best of Bridge, which went on to become one of the most successful brands in Canadian publishing. </p><p> From the outset, "The Ladies of the Best of Bridge," as they like to be known, had a unconventional vision of how their business would be run. It would be a partnership of equals, a celebration of friendship and -- perhaps most of all -- it would be fun. The bank manager who approved their first loan warned them they would never stay friends. They vowed to prove him wrong. </p><p> More than 30 years and three million copies later, the ladies are enjoying the last laugh. In addition to creating a phenomenally successful business, they have remained close friends with fond memories of all the good times they've shared. "We had a lot of fun," they say now. "And the media loved us because we were just regular mothers who showed up wearing matching aprons. Sometimes people were astonished that the recipes actually worked, which amazed us because we knew what we were doing." </p><p> Not surprisingly, from time to time, life intervened to rock their idyll. "Like a large family, we've experienced everything -- divorce, major illness and deaths," they comment. Not only have they lost parents, husbands and children, two of the partners are deceased. </p><p> But the brand lives on -- not only in kitchens, but also in the hearts and minds of Canadians from coast to coast. Written in a welcoming style, the recipes are easy to execute, yet produce "gourmet" results. Their unique approach, which includes jokes to keep cooks smiling, has ensured a faithful following. Best of Bridge recipes are staples at potlucks across the country, and the generation of children raised on them is now cooking for themselves. "We get lots of mail from people looking for specific books to give to their adult kids," the Ladies report. "They want to make dishes that were always served at family celebrations. Our recipes have become part of their domestic traditions." </p><p> The Best of Bridge is more than a company. It's an institution that is deeply interwoven into the fabric of Canadian life. But more than that, it's a testament to the spirit and wherewithal of eight exceptional women whose collective head for business is matched by their commitment to each other. As the Ladies would say, "You should have these books. We've tested, tasted and revised. We promise you'll love every recipe." </p></p><h2>The Road from Mont P�lerin: The Making of the Neoliberal Thought Collective, With a New Preface</h2><p><p>Although modern neoliberalism was born at the &#x201c;Colloque Walter Lippmann&#x201d; in 1938, it only came into its own with the founding of the Mont P�lerin Society, a partisan &#x201c;thought collective,&#x201d; in Vevey, Switzerland, in 1947. Its original membership was made up of transnational economists and intellectuals, including Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, George Stigler, Karl Popper, Michael Polanyi, and Luigi Einaudi. From this small beginning, their ideas spread throughout the world, fostering, among other things, the political platforms of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan and the Washington Consensus.</p><p><i>The Road from Mont P�lerin</i> presents the key debates and conflicts that occurred among neoliberal scholars and their political and corporate allies regarding trade unions, development economics, antitrust policies, and the influence of philanthropy.

As Stephen King said: &#x201c;No one surpasses Ruth Rendell.&#x201d;</p><p>Ruth Rendell (1930&#x2013;2015) won three Edgar Awards, the highest accolade from Mystery Writers of America, as well as four Gold Daggers and a Diamond Dagger for outstanding contribution to the genre from England&#x2019;s prestigious Crime Writ�ers&#x2019; Association. Her remarkable career spanned a half century, with more than sixty books published. A member of the House of Lords, she was one of the great literary figures of our time.No Man&#x2019;s Nightingale 1<p></p> <br>MAXINE WAS PROUD of having three jobs. These days more and more people had none. She had no sympathy for them but congratulated herself on her own initiative. Two mornings a week she cleaned for Mrs. Wexford, two mornings for Mrs. Crocker, afternoons for two other Kingsmarkham women, did gardening and cleaned cars for Mr. Wexford and Dr. Crocker and babysat every evening where she was wanted for those young enough to need a baby-sitter. Cleaning she did for the women and gardening and car-washing for the men because she had never believed in any of that feminism or equality stuff. It was a well-known fact that men didn&#x2019;t notice whether a house was clean or not, and normal women weren&#x2019;t interested in cars or lawns. Maxine charged maximum rates for baby-sitting except for her son and his partner, who got her services for free. As for the others, those who had kids must expect to pay for them. She&#x2019;d had four and she knew.<br> <br>She was a good worker, reliable, punctual, and reasonably honest, and the only condition she made was payment in cash. Wexford, who after all had until recently been a policeman, demurred at that but eventually gave in the way the tax inspector up the road did. After all, at least a dozen other households would have paid almost anything to secure Maxine&#x2019;s services. She had one drawback. She talked. She talked not just while she was having a break for a cup of tea or while she was getting out or putting away the tools, but all the time she was working and to whoever happened to be in the room or upstairs in the kitchen. The work got done and efficiently while the words poured out on a steady monotone.<br> <br>That day she began on a story of how her son Jason, now manager of the Kingsmarkham Questo supermarket, had dealt with a man complaining about one of Jason&#x2019;s checkout girls. The woman had apparently called him &#x201c;elderly.&#x201d; But Jason had handled it brilliantly, pacifying the man and sending him home in a supervisor&#x2019;s car. &#x201c;Now my Jason used to be a right tearaway,&#x201d; Maxine went on, and not for the first time. &#x201c;Not in one of them gangs, I&#x2019;m not saying that, and he never got no ASBOs, but a bit of shoplifting, it was like it came natural to him, and out all night and underage drinking&#x2014;well, binge-drinking like they call it. As for the smack and what do they call them, description drugs&#x2014;mind Mr. Wexford can&#x2019;t hear me, hope he&#x2019;s out of hearshot&#x2014;all that he went in for, and now, since him and Nicky had a kid, he&#x2019;s a changed character. The perfect dad, I still can&#x2019;t believe it.&#x201d; She applied impregnated wadding to the silver with renewed vigour, then a duster, then the wadding once more. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s over a year old now, his Isabella is, but when she was a neo-nettle, it was never Nicky got up to her in the night, she never had to. No, it was my Jason had her out of her cot before the first peep was out of her. Walked her up and down, cooing at her like I&#x2019;ve never heard a bloke go on so. Mind you, that Nicky never showed no gratitude. I call it unnatural a mum with a new baby sleeping the night through, and I&#x2019;ve told her so.&#x201d;<br> <br>Even Maxine sometimes had to pause to draw breath. Dora Wexford seized her opportunity, said she had to go out and Maxine&#x2019;s money was in an envelope on the hall table. The resumed monologue pursued her as she ran out to the conservatory to tell her husband she&#x2019;d be back in an hour or so.<br> <br>Wexford was sitting in a cane armchair in autumn sunshine doing what many a man or woman plans to do on retirement but few put into practice, reading The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. He had embarked on it expecting to find it heavy going, but instead becoming fast enraptured and enjoying every word. Reaching the end of the first volume, he was happy to anticipate five more and told Dora she&#x2019;d picked her moment to desert him.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s your turn,&#x201d; she whispered.<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know we had a schedule.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know now. Here starts your tour of duty.&#x201d;<br> <br>As Dora left, Maxine swooped, pushing the vacuum cleaner and continuing to hold on to it while she peered over his shoulder.<br> <br>&#x201c;Got a guide to Rome there, I see. Going there on your holidays, are you? Me and my sister took in Rome on our Ten Italian Cities tour. Oh, it was lovely but hot, you wouldn&#x2019;t believe. I said to my Jason, you and Nicky want to go there on your honeymoon when you get around to tying the knot there&#x2019;s no untying, only these days there is of course, no point in getting married if you ask me. I never did and I&#x2019;m not ashamed of it.&#x201d; She started up the vacuum cleaner but continued to talk. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Nicky as wants it, one of them big white weddings like they all want these days, costs thousands, but she&#x2019;s a big spender, good job my Jason&#x2019;s in work like so many&#x2019;s not.&#x201d; The voice became a buzz under the vacuum&#x2019;s roar. She raised it. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t reckon my Jason&#x2019;d go away on a honeymoon or anything else come to that without Isabella. He can&#x2019;t bear that kid out of his sight for his eight hours&#x2019; work let alone a week. Talk about worshipping the ground she treads on, only she don&#x2019;t tread yet, crawls more like.&#x201d; A pause to change the tool on the end of the vacuum-cleaner hose. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll know about that poor lady vicar getting herself killed and me finding the body. It was all over the papers and on the telly. I reckon you take an interest though you&#x2019;re not doing the work no more. I had a cleaning job there with her up till a couple of weeks back, but there was things we never saw eye to eye on, not to mention her not wanting to pay cash, wanted to do it on line if you please and I couldn&#x2019;t be doing with that. She always left the back door open and I popped in to collect the money she owed me and it gave me a terrible turn. No blood, of course, not with strangling, but still a shock. Don&#x2019;t bear thinking of, does it? Still, I reckon you had to think of things like that, it being your job. You must be relieved getting all that over with . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Standing up, clutching his book, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to have a bath!&#x201d; Wexford shouted above the vacuum&#x2019;s roar.<br> <br>Maxine was startled from her monologue. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s ten thirty.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A very good time to have a bath,&#x201d; said Wexford, making for the stairs, reading as he went the last lines of volume one, describing another murder, that of Julius Caesar: . . . during the greatest part of a year, the orb of the sun appeared pale and without splendour. This season of obscurity, which cannot surely be compared with the preternatural obscurity of the Passion, had already been celebrated by most of the poets and historians of that memorable age. . . .<br> <br>His mobile was ringing. Detective Superintendent Burden, known to the phone-contacts list as Mike.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m off to have a look at St. Peter&#x2019;s Vicarage, taking Lynn with me and I thought you might like to come too.&#x201d;<br> <br>Wexford had already had a shower that day. A bath at 10:30 a.m. wasn&#x2019;t needful, only seized upon as a refuge from Maxine. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d love to.&#x201d; He tried to keep the enthusiasm out of his voice, tried and failed.<br> <br>Sounding surprised, Burden said, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t get excited. It&#x2019;s no big deal.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It is for me.&#x201d;<br> <br>He closed the bathroom door. Probably, Maxine wouldn&#x2019;t open it but would perhaps conclude that he was having an exceptionally long bath. The vacuum cleaner still roaring, he escaped out the front door, closing it after him by an almost silent turning of the key in the lock. Taking an interested member of the public&#x2014;that, after all, was what he was&#x2014;on a call or calls that were part of a criminal investigation was something Wexford had seldom done while he was himself an investigating officer. And his accompanying Superintendent Ede of the Met on the vault enquiries was a different matter as he, though unpaid, had had a kind of job as Ede&#x2019;s aide. This visit, this opportune escape from Maxine, was undergone, he knew, because, once senior and junior officers, over the years they had become friends. Burden knew, none better, how much Wexford would wish to be involved in solving the mystery of who had killed the Reverend Sarah Hussain.<br> <br><br> <br>ALL WEXFORD KNEW of the death, apart from what Maxine had mentioned that morning, was what he had read in yesterday&#x2019;s Guardian and seen on the day-before-yesterday&#x2019;s regional television news. And seen of course when passing the vicarage. He could have seen more online, but he had cringed from its colourful headlines. Sarah Hussain was far from being the only woman ordained priest of the Church of England, but perhaps she was the only one to have been born in the United Kingdom of a white Irishwoman and an Indian immigrant. All this had been in the newspaper along with some limited biographical details, including information about her conversion to Christianity. There had been a photograph too of a gaunt woman with an aquiline nose in an academic cap and gown, olive-skinned but with large, deep-set, black eyes and what hair that showed a glossy jet-black. She had been forty-eight when she died and a single mother.<br> <br>Her origins, her looks&#x2014;striking but not handsome&#x2014;her age, her single parenthood, and, above all, that conversion made him think that her life could not have been easy. He would have liked to know more, and no doubt, he soon would. At the moment he wasn&#x2019;t even sure of where the murder had taken place, only that it was inside the vicarage. It wasn&#x2019;t a house he had ever been in, though Dora had. He was due to meet Mike and DC Lynn Fancourt in St. Peter&#x2019;s Church porch, the one at the side where the vestry was.<br> <br>The vicarage was some distance away and he had no need to pass the church to reach it. Heading for the gate that led out of Queen Street, he passed a young man pushing a baby buggy, a not particularly unusual sight these days, but he recognized this one as Maxine&#x2019;s son Jason. As industrious as his mother if not as vociferous, he must be having a day off from his job as a supermarket manager. Curious to see the child whose father worshipped the ground she crawled on, Wexford looked under the buggy hood and saw a pretty, pink-cheeked blonde, her long-lashed eyes closed in sleep. Wexford hastily withdrew his head from Jason&#x2019;s glare. No doubt the man was wary of any male person eyeing his little girl. Quite right too, he thought, himself the parent of girls who were now middle-aged women.<br> <br>He was a little early and by design. In his position it was better for him to be waiting for them than they for him. But Burden was seldom late, and the two of them appeared almost immediately from the high street. All the years he had known him, Wexford had never ceased to marvel at Burden&#x2019;s sartorial elegance. Where did he learn to dress like that? As far as he knew, Mike went shopping no more than any other man of Wexford&#x2019;s acquaintance. And it couldn&#x2019;t be the influence of his wives, neither of whom, Jean, long dead, or Jenny, the present one, had had much interest in clothes, preferring in their own cases no more than attention to &#x201c;neatness and fashion,&#x201d; as Jane Austen has it. But here was Burden today, his abundant but short hair now iron grey, his beige jacket (surely cashmere) over white shirt with beige-and-blue-figured tie, his beautifully creased trousers of denim, though discernibly&#x2014;how? How could one tell?&#x2014;not jeans.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good to see you,&#x201d; Burden said, though he had seen him and eaten lunch with him three days before.<br> <br>Lynn, whom he hadn&#x2019;t seen for as much as a year, said in a respectful tone, &#x201c;Good morning, sir.&#x201d;<br> <br>They walked along the path among gravestones and rosebushes towards Vicarage Lane. It was October and the leaves had only just begun to fall. Green, spiky conkers lay on the grass under the chestnut trees.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how much you know about this poor woman&#x2019;s murder, Reg,&#x201d; Burden said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Only what I read in the paper and saw on TV.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t go to church, do you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I hesitate to say my wife does, though it&#x2019;s true, and you know it already. She knew Sarah Hussain but through church, not socially. Where was she killed?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;In the vicarage. In her living room. You tell him, Lynn. You were one of the two officers who were the first to see the body.&#x201d;</p><h2>Pan-Africanism and Communism: The Communist International, Africa and the Diaspora, 1919-1939 (Harriet Tubman)</h2><p>A rich and textured monograph, which is destined to become the definitive work in the field. Afua Cooper, James Robinson Johnston Chair in Black Canadian Studies, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia Based on new materials from the archives of the Communist International in Moscow as well as other established sources, Professor Hakim Adi has given us the very first book that explains the history and activities of The International Trade Union Committee of Negro Workers (ITUCNW) in relation to the attainment of black emancipation, the role of such leading figures as George Padmore, the nuanced discussions within the communist movement on Pan Africanism and how to attain liberation from colonial domination. The book abounds with new insights, original reflections, fresh interpretation and new conclusions on what was generally called the Negro Question. Toyin Falola, University Distinguished Teaching Professor and the Frances Higginbothom Nalle Centennial Professor, University of Texas in Austin The struggle by Africans at home and in the Diaspora against the innumerable forms of exploitation and discrimination existing in the 1920s and 1930s was supported by only one major international organisation, the Comintern. This remarkable pan-Africanist approach is fully documented and analysed in Hakim Adi s book that links the struggles in Africa, Europe and the Americas.

Yet his writings have been largely overlooked because they were published piecemeal over the course of twenty-five years and never adequately collected or analyzed. In this book, Garrick A. Bailey brings together in a clear, understandable way La Flesche&#x2019;s data for two important Osage religious ceremonies--the "Songs of Wa-xo&#x2019;-be," an initiation into a clan priesthood, and the Rite of the Chiefs, an initiation into a tribal priesthood. To put La Flesche&#x2019;s work into perspective, Bailey offers a short biography of this prolific Native American scholar and an overview of traditional Osage religious beliefs and practices.</p></p><p></p><h2>A Cursed Inheritance (Wesley Peterson)</h2><p><p>The brutal massacre of the Harford family at Potwoolstan Hall in Devon in 1985 shocked the country and passed into local folklore.

But still.<br> <br>I hadn&#x2019;t been invited to Willow&#x2019;s Halloween party, and I was okay with it. Unlike a lot of my classmates, I didn&#x2019;t plan my schedule around her parties, which were usually sweaty and overcrowded, the sort of thing where you spent the whole time shouting over music you&#x2019;d never listen to on your own. She&#x2019;d always invited me to her Halloween parties before, and I&#x2019;d always gone, mostly because my two best friends, Tessa Pollock and Lucy Yang, were going, and the three of us always stuck together. Everyone knew this, even Willow, who never paid us much attention. The weird thing was how she&#x2019;d invited Lucy (even though she never hung out with Willow) and Tessa (even though Willow pretty much hated her). But not me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t feel bad, Mattie,&#x201d; Lucy urged me. She looked worried. Lucy was always fussing over this sort of stuff, trying to make sure everyone felt comfortable. The idea that she was invited when I wasn&#x2019;t . . . well, I could tell she felt terrible. &#x201c;I heard she invited only half the class, so I&#x2019;m sure it wasn&#x2019;t personal.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How could it not be personal?&#x201d; Tessa demanded. &#x201c;Willow decides who&#x2019;s invited and who&#x2019;s not. What could be more personal than that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You guys, I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; I insisted. But still, I tried to think if I&#x2019;d offended Willow lately, if maybe I&#x2019;d forgotten to congratulate her on scoring a goal or something. Willow was the type of person who expected face-to-face compliments, not just cheers.<br> <br>Tessa snorted. &#x201c;Of course you&#x2019;re not fine, Mattie. How could anyone be fine about being left out of the biggest party all year?&#x201d;<br> <br>We were at Verona&#x2019;s, this new fro-yo place in town where you could design your own sundaes. I was having chocolate fudge with chocolate chips and crushed brownies, Lucy was having strawberry with a bunch of fruit on top, and Tessa was having vanilla drowned in almost every topping available&#x2014;gummies, marshmallows, peanut butter cups, hot fudge, strawberry syrup, coconut. It looked like a small volcano had erupted in her cup, trapping gummy bears in lava. Like a yogurt Pompeii or something.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, Mattie, if you&#x2019;re not going, neither am I,&#x201d; Lucy said.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I don&#x2019;t know why this surprised me, because it was typical Lucy. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s really sweet, but it wouldn&#x2019;t be fair. I mean, to you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you joking? Why would I do something that wasn&#x2019;t fair to you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Listen, we&#x2019;re all going. Including Mattie,&#x201d; Tessa declared, waving her spoon for emphasis.<br> <br>I took an enormous bite of my creation. &#x201c;Well, aside from the fact that Willow obviously doesn&#x2019;t want me there, it&#x2019;s supposed to be a costume party, right? And I&#x2019;m not a costumey sort of person.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How can you say that?&#x201d; Lucy protested. &#x201c;Your costumes are always so original, Mattie. That year you went as the Sorting Hat&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah. People just thought I was a witch.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, but last year, when you went as Matilda&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>I groaned at the memory. Last year, I&#x2019;d thought: Okay, my name is Matilda; how much more obvious could it be? Besides, who hasn&#x2019;t read Matilda? So I wore my half-sister Cara&#x2019;s old school uniform and my brother Mason&#x2019;s tie, and I made my hair all crazy with spray. Liam Harrison, the coolest boy in the grade (at least, according to him), asked if I was Eloise. You know, the bratty little girl at that hotel. Clearly, I was the worst at costumes.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m the worst at costumes,&#x201d; I told my friends.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe you&#x2019;re overthinking it,&#x201d; Tessa said. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t always have to do a book thing, do you? You could just wear a really cool mask.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t own a mask. Even a non-cool one.&#x201d;<br> <br>She poked two holes in her napkin and held it over my face. &#x201c;Voil�: mask. And the thing about wearing a costume, Mattie? No one will know it&#x2019;s you.&#x201d; She stage-whispered the last part, cupping her hands over her mouth.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, maybe,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;If I totally cover myself, including my head. And if I disguise my voice. But I don&#x2019;t know, the idea of sneaking into Willow&#x2019;s party&#x2014;&#x201d; I shook my head.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mattie, come on,&#x201d; Lucy cut in. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t spend Halloween sitting home by yourself; it&#x2019;s bad luck, or bad karma. Bad something.&#x201d; She ate a raspberry. &#x201c;Oh, and by the way,&#x201d; she added, &#x201c;not that it matters, but I heard Elijah&#x2019;s going.&#x201d;<br> <br>I poked a brownie chunk with my spoon. &#x201c;Yeah? Well, woohoo.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, so what did I miss?&#x201d; Tessa had been away all last weekend at a theater camp reunion, and was still catching up on the news. &#x201c;What happened with Elijah?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;I saw him at the library on Sunday, so I said hello. It was like, Hey, how was your weekend, wanna hear about mine? He didn&#x2019;t even answer.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Whoa,&#x201d; Tessa said. &#x201c;Literally didn&#x2019;t?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yep. Totally ignored me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe he wasn&#x2019;t ignoring you; maybe he just didn&#x2019;t hear,&#x201d; Lucy suggested.<br> <br>I raised my eyebrows at her. &#x201c;In a quiet library? When I was talking exactly as loud as this?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe he had earbuds in?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Lucy, he was just sitting in the graphic novel section reading old Batman comics. No earbuds, no anything. I checked.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tessa licked some fro-yo off her spoon. &#x201c;You know, I hate to say this, Mattie, but in my opinion Elijah&#x2019;s a stuck-up dirtbag.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re probably right. The stupid thing is, I think I still like him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That is stupid,&#x201d; Tessa agreed. &#x201c;Why do you like him?&#x201d;<br> <br>I sighed. Because how do you answer that kind of question? It&#x2019;s like explaining why you think a joke is funny, or why a song stays in your head. Or why you like chocolate fudge frozen yogurt, or the color blue. You just like what you like. Like who you like. Even if the person acts like a stuck-up dirtbag sometimes.<br> <br>Besides, liking Elijah was just what I did. What I&#x2019;d done since the start of seventh grade last year, when I suddenly realized that I kept staring at him. He wasn&#x2019;t just cute, with his wavy dark hair and his big brown eyes&#x2014;he was really smart, especially about words. He always raised his hand in English and said non-obvious things. I could tell our teacher, Mr. Torres, appreciated his comments. And how many eighth-grade boys spent summer vacation at the town library? Only Elijah.<br> <br>I mean, really, considering me, it made perfect sense for me to have him as my crush. For an entire year, I scribbled his name in the back of my math binder and tried to think up words that rhymed with Elijah (beside ya?) while he read Batman comics or whatever.<br> <br>Because the thing was, who else was I supposed to like?<br> <br>But it was hard to say this without sounding slightly loser-ish. Or like a person who enjoyed feeling sorry for herself. Which I didn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>&#x201c;Earth to Mattie,&#x201d; Tessa said. &#x201c;Come in, spacegirl.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, sorry. I was just thinking.&#x201d; I stirred my fro-yo counterclockwise, then ate a spoonful of soggy chocolate chips. &#x201c;I guess I like Elijah&#x2019;s eyebrows. And the way he laughs.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tessa snorted. &#x201c;Okay, well, that explains everything.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mattie, listen to me,&#x201d; Lucy said, reaching across the table to pat my shoulder. &#x201c;Go to Willow&#x2019;s party, wear a costume, take a really good look at Elijah. See how he acts if he doesn&#x2019;t know it&#x2019;s you. It&#x2019;ll be a test: If you still think he&#x2019;s worth spending the entire year crushing on, go ahead. But maybe you&#x2019;ll decide he isn&#x2019;t worth it. And maybe you&#x2019;ll notice someone else.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah? Like who?&#x201d; By then, we&#x2019;d noticed everyone in middle school. There was nobody left to notice.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Lucy admitted. &#x201c;I just think you should keep your eyes open.&#x201d;<br> <br>Right then, Charlotte Pangel and Isabel Guzman walked into Verona&#x2019;s. They were two of Willow Kaplan&#x2019;s sidekicks, always playing on Willow&#x2019;s teams, or cheering for her in the stands. Seriously, it was strange that they were here without her, because they tagged after Willow all over town. Charlotte and Isabel were the kind of girls who were always whispering to each other; whatever they were saying, it was probably something you&#x2019;d rather not hear.<br> <br>I poked Lucy&#x2019;s elbow. &#x201c;Come on, let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; Tessa challenged me. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t finished eating.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just take it with you,&#x201d; Lucy said.<br> <br>&#x201c;But I like it here. I like these chairs. Don&#x2019;t you think these chairs are really comfy?&#x201d; Tessa sat back in hers, kicking out her skinny legs as if she were sunning herself by a pool. She scooped up a spoonful of fro-yo lava and beamed at us.<br> <br>Lucy and I exchanged glances. I could tell she wanted to leave as much as I did, but neither of us trusted Tessa enough to leave her behind. The thing about Tessa was, sometimes her Off switch malfunctioned. Especially around people who didn&#x2019;t appreciate her coolness.<br> <br>So the three of us sat there, not budging, while Charlotte and Isabel helped themselves to yogurt and toppings, paid the lady at the counter, who was possibly Verona, then took seats at a table opposite us. Lucy and I pantomimed eating, even though by then there was nothing left in our paper cups.<br> <br>Charlotte and Isabel whispered. The radio was playing some Mom-era song, and Possibly Verona was humming along as she sprayed and wiped the counter.<br> <br>Finally, Charlotte slapped down her spoon. &#x201c;Okay, that is just. So. Rude.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tessa blinked at her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Right, Tessa. Like you don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I really don&#x2019;t, Charlotte. Why don&#x2019;t you tell me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The way you keep staring at us,&#x201d; Isabel said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s kind of creepy, actually.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tessa raised her eyebrows. &#x201c;You think I&#x2019;m staring at you? Why would I even want to?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who knows?&#x201d; Charlotte said, smirking. &#x201c;Maybe you&#x2019;re wondering what it&#x2019;s like not to be ugly.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tessa paled. Considering she was naturally fair-skinned, with wispy blond hair and light blue eyes, pale on her looked kind of alarming.<br> <br>But then it was like something clicked inside her, and she practically leaped out of her chair. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m ugly? You&#x2019;re like a toad; ugly and venomous. Thy face is not worth sunburning.&#x201d;<br> <br>Uh-oh, I thought. Because I&#x2019;d seen this before: When Tessa got too angry to think up words, she quoted lines from plays. Often it got on people&#x2019;s nerves.<br> <br>&#x201c;?&#x2018;Thy&#x2019;?&#x201d; Charlotte hooted. &#x201c;?&#x2018;Thy&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tessa, come on, we need to leave,&#x201d; I said, grabbing her arm.<br> <br>She pulled away from me, avoiding my eyes. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Shakespeare,&#x201d; she informed Charlotte. &#x201c;It means &#x2018;your&#x2019;: Your face is not worth sunburning.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know what &#x2018;thy&#x2019; means, you moron. I meant, who talks like that?&#x201d;<br> <br>Tessa did a fancy bow. &#x201c;I do.&#x201d;<br> <br>Isabel rolled her eyes. &#x201c;Yeah, Tessa, and we all love hearing it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, guys,&#x201d; Lucy said, stepping in front of Charlotte. &#x201c;Can we all please . . . ?&#x201d;<br> <br>Tessa ignored her. &#x201c;At least I have something to show off. But you, Charlotte, are just Willow&#x2019;s little shadow. You can&#x2019;t think one single thought for yourself. &#x2018;Thou hast no more brain than I have in mine elbows.&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There she goes again,&#x201d; Isabel told Charlotte. &#x201c;?&#x2018;Mine elbows.&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, is Shakespeare hard for you?&#x201d; Tessa asked sympathetically. &#x201c;Allow me to translate. &#x2018;Mine&#x2019; means &#x2018;my&#x2019;; &#x2018;elbows&#x2019; means &#x2018;elbows.&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>The door opened. In walked Willow. As soon as she entered the shop, you could tell she smelled a fight. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d; she asked in a sharp, accusing voice.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; I said quickly. &#x201c;Charlotte and Tessa were just arguing. But it&#x2019;s over now, right?&#x201d; I glared at Tessa.<br> <br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; Willow narrowed her eyes at me. &#x201c;Well, it doesn&#x2019;t look over. It doesn&#x2019;t feel over.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because it&#x2019;s not,&#x201d; Charlotte said. &#x201c;Tessa just basically called me stupid.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Huh. Did she? The thing is, Tessa, if you&#x2019;re being nasty to my friend&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Tessa&#x2019;s cheeks turned pink. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just defending myself, Willow! Am I supposed to stand here and allow your little lapdog&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, so now you&#x2019;re calling me a dog?&#x201d; Charlotte&#x2019;s eyes popped.<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Tessa said. &#x201c;Although, actually, &#x2018;I do wish thou wert a dog, that I might love thee something.&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Should I translate, Charlotte? &#x2018;Thee&#x2019; means&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;STOP,&#x201d; Possibly Verona shouted. She was in front of us now, her hands on her hips. &#x201c;If you girls can&#x2019;t have a pleasant, quiet conversation without name-calling, you aren&#x2019;t welcome here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But she started it,&#x201d; Charlotte protested, pointing at Tessa.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not true,&#x201d; I said loudly. Lucy frowned at me.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care who started anything,&#x201d; Verona snapped. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my shop, and I can&#x2019;t have fighting in here, period. Now why don&#x2019;t you girls take your fro-yos and come back when you can act decently, like well-behaved young women.&#x201d;<br> <br>She walked over to the door and held it open for us. It occurred to me that I&#x2019;d never been kicked out of anywhere before&#x2014;and I hadn&#x2019;t done anything to deserve it. Although in a way, I wished I had. I mean, I sort of just felt like a spectator.<br> <br>All six of us filed out of Verona&#x2019;s. Tessa was the last to exit, and as she did, she did another fancy bow, doing a complicated hand gesture that ended with her tipping an imaginary hat.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fairest lady, I humbly take my leave,&#x201d; said Tessa.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, right,&#x201d; growled Definitely Verona.</p><h2>Daily Light on the Daily Path: New Life Version</h2><p>Get a fresh perspective on the beloved devotional <i>Daily Light</i>&#x2014;now in the easy-to-understand language of the New Life Version.

They are lapstrake-constructed from marine plywood planks, each plank overlapping the one below it in a gracefully curved hull. Epoxy glue along the laps gives the hull structural reinforcement, minimizing the need for framing and permitting an amazingly light structure. Round-bilged and elegant, they are built over jigs, but the method is straightforward and not time consuming. You can build a boat that will give you fun and satisfaction, one you can be proud of, in a winter of leisurely weekends. No fancy tools are needed, and care and patience will make up whatever you lack in woodworking skills. </p><p>All the information you need is here. Tom Hill, the chief proponent of ultralight boatbuilding and its leading practitioner, describes the method from start to finish using a skiff and canoe as examples. In the appendix is a gallery of ultralight designs, all but one of which you can build without lofting. If you want more flexibility, however, you can adapt almost any lapstrake small-boat design, traditional or modern, to the ultralight method. With some lofting (directions for which are given) you may then build a wide range of boats whose offsets are available. And you may adjust planking thickness and scantlings to give your boat extremely light weight with normal strength, or moderate weight with great strength. </p><p>Particularly if you lack an extensively equipped workshop and professional skills, <i>Ultralight Boatbuilding</i> will unlock exciting possibilities you considered out of reach.</p></p><p><b>Tom Hill</b> lives in Huntington, in the Green Mountains of Vermont, where he has been building boats and houses since 1972. He reckons he has built more than a hundred boats in that time, and has repaired hundreds more--everything from canoes and rowboats to 60-foot power yachts. Although he has worked with all types of wood construction as well as fiberglass, he has used glued plywood plank construction almost exclusively since being introduced to the method in 1980. Tom has taught boatbuilding classes since 1981 at The WoodenBoat School (Brooklin, Maine), The Brookfield Craft Center (Brookfield, Connecticut), the Shelburne Craft School (Shelburne, Vermont), and The Appalachian Center for the Crafts (Smithville, Tennessee). The boating he likes best is gunkholing--poking along interesting shores and exploring coves, estuaries, and inland waterways in canoes, kayaks, and small sailboats--but he appreciates ocean cruising as well, and once sailed his 28-foot sloop from Lake Champlain to the Bahamas and back while living aboard her for a year."A marvelous book which has broken fresh ground on quality, low-cost construction of traditional hull forms.

Another then second-lieutenant, destined to see many more armies; U.S. Grant, also thought highly of them: &#39;The rank and file were probably inferior ... to the volunteers that participated in all the later battles of the war; but they were brave men, and then drill and discipline brought out all there was in them.&#39; Philip Katcher writes the story of the regulars and volunteers who fought in the Mexican-American War, detailing the infantry, cavalry, artillery and staff of both the American and Mexican armies.</p><p>Packed with specially commissioned artwork, maps and diagrams, the Men-at-Arms series is an unrivalled illustrated reference on the history, organisation, uniforms and equipment of the world&#39;s military forces, past and present.Phililp Katcher lives and works in Pennsylvania USA, and has written over 20 titles in the Men-at-Arms Series including the highly successful five-volume set on Armies of the American Civil War.</p><h2>Mystery in the Old Red Barn</h2><p><p>When their Uncle Bill comes to visit, Reed and Kathie have great fun playing with him in the old red barn.

Christ has just been crucified, and they are heartbroken&#x2015;until a third man joins them on the road and comforts them. Once they reach Emmaus and break bread, the pair realizes they have been walking with Christ himself. But in the moment they recognize him, he disappears. Spencer Reece draws on this tender story in his mesmerizing collection&#x2015;one that fearlessly confronts love and its loss, despair and its consolation, and faith in all of its various guises.</p><p>Reece's central figure in <i>The Road to Emmaus</i> is a middle-aged man who becomes a priest in the Episcopal Church; these poems follow him to New York City, to Honduras, to a hospital where he works as a chaplain, to a prison, to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. With language of simple, lyrical beauty that gradually accrues weight and momentum, Reece spins compelling dramas out of small moments: the speaker, living among a group of orphans, wondering "Was it true, what they said, that a priest is a house lit up?"; two men finding each other at a Coming Out Group; a man trying to become visible after a life that had depended on not being seen.</p><p>A yearning for connection, an ache of loneliness, and the instant of love disappearing before our eyes haunt this long-awaited second collection from Spencer Reece.</p></p><p><b>Spencer Reece </b>is a poet and priest. His first collection, <i>The Clerk's Tale</i>, won the Bakeless Prize in 2003. He has received an NEA grant, a Guggenheim grant, a Witter Bynner Fellowship from the Library of Congress, a Whiting Writers' Award, and the Amy Lowell Travelling Scholarship. His poems have been published in <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>Poetry</i>, <i>The American Scholar</i>, and <i>The New Republic</i>. He served at the Honduran orphanage Our Little Roses, and works for the Bishop of Spain at the Reformed Episcopal Church, Iglesia Espa�ola Reformada Episcopal.<p>&#x201c;For Spencer Reece, humbling is a given. Even though his language in <i>The Road to Emmaus,</i> his first book since his ordination, is often remarkably inventive and sometimes formally elegant, the poems' tone never betrays awareness of his achievement . . . There's a quality of devotion in all of these that can make the secular seem sacred. One can truly attend through attention, the writing suggests, and the poems manage to be unwavering--almost unvarying--in the quality of their gaze.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Jonathan Farmer, Slate</i></p><p>&#x201c;Reece follows up his acclaimed first book with a gorgeous series of poems in verse and prose about a middle-aged man's coming to terms with religious faith, going as far as becoming a priest, a hospital chaplain, and a quiet chronicler of everyday suffering. 'It is correct to love even at the wrong time,' he writes of a visit to newborns in an ICU. Reece's style is straightforward, but always graceful, understatedly beautiful. These poems compassionately describe all the stops along this journey, which leads across America and elsewhere, always inviting readers to respond: 'it was an interview, much of life is an interview.'&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Craig Morgan Teicher, NPR</i></p><p>&#x201c;The Road to Emmaus confirms why I have always looked to Reece's work not only as inspiration for my own poems, but also as a guide for my soul. In this collection I follow his every footstep as he walks toward himself-toward myself-stopping to admire or fear what we see in ourselves, in others, in each other. Each poem a portrait or a self-portrait exquisitely and painstakingly drawn along the way, by the side of that proverbial road we journey with him, encountering life in all its loneliness and wholeness, its lucidness and doubt, its bitterness and glory.&#x201d; &#x2015;Richard Blanco, Presidential Inaugural Poet and author of Looking for The Gulf Motel</p><p>&#x201c;These poems form a true and riveting narrative. Reading Reece makes you recall why you love poetry.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Annie Dillard, author of The Maytrees and Pilgrim at Tinker Creek</i></p><p>&#x201c;Though many of Spencer Reece's poems move forward with the narrative punch of short stories, they are packed with poetry's exquisite insight and metaphoric brilliance. These are moral poems that speak of loneliness in terms so intimate that they seem to breech loneliness; they are both documents of isolation and manifestos of love. And they achieve such embrace via lyric bursts that are arresting, evocative, and profound.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Andrew Solomon, author of Far From the Tree and The Noonday Demon</i></p><p>&#x201c;Reece's poems are at once splendidly fresh and deeply rooted in poetry's rich loam . . .

With new interviews, never-before-published material, and fresh insights, Turner helps the reader understand the religious and spiritual ideas and ideals that influenced the music and lives of the Beatles and helps us see how the Fab Four influenced our own lives and culture.</p><p>Topics discussed include the religious upbringing of John, Paul, George, and Ringo; the backlash in the United States after John Lennon's "The Beatles are more popular than Jesus" comment; the dabbling in Eastern religion; the use of drugs to attempt to enter a higher level of consciousness; and the overall legacy that the Beatles and their music have left. While there is no religious system that permanently anchored the Beatles or their music, they did leave a gospel, Turner concludes: one of love, peace, personal freedom, and the search for transcendence.</p></p><p><b>Steve Turner</b> is a British rock journalist and author of more than thirty books, including <i>The Man Called Cash</i>, <i>Amazing Grace: The Story of America's Beloved Song</i>, and <i>A Hard Day's Write: The Stories Behind Every Beatles Song</i>. He lives in London.In 1967, drug guru Timothy Leary proclaimed, "[T]he message from Liverpool is the Newest Testament, chanted by Four Evangelists&#x2014;saints John, Paul, George, and Ringo." Leary certainly captured the feelings of a generation pursuing freedom from old social conventions and searching for love in the lyrics, looks and music of the Beatles. In less than a decade, the group evolved from the fun-loving frantic boys of <i>A Hard Day's Night</i> (1964) to the philosophical poets of <i>Abbey Road</i> (1969) and <i>Let It Be</i> (1970), weaving more references to religion and spirituality into their music. Acclaimed pop music writer Turner (<i>A Man Called Cash</i>) unsuccessfully attempts to reveal the "gospel" of the Fab Four in this plodding book. He recounts the already well-known biographies of each Beatle, pointing out that each had some early brushes with either the Church of England or Roman Catholicism. Turner takes John Lennon's now-infamous 1966 claim that the Beatles were "more popular than Jesus" as his starting point and then examines superficially the well-known turn East that the group took in the late 1960s. The book lacks in-depth interpretations of the Beatles' song lyrics and fails to account for the rich and complex meanings that arguably make their lyrics some of the most religious in rock. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

If the rest of the commentators live up to the high standard set by Pelikan . . . the series could end up marking a turning point in the history of biblical hermeneutics. . . . One finishes this marvelously lucid book not only excited at the prospect of future volumes, but also wondering if this series will be revolutionary in another sense: Could this be a set of commentaries on the Bible that people will actually read?"<br>--<b>Edward T. Oakes, SJ</b>, <i>First Things<br><br></i>"Pelikan's inaugural volume on Acts sets a high and honorable standard for the series. . . . Pelikan's interpretive focus on creeds and other church traditions results in an evocative network of conceptual associations, linking words and ideas in Acts to doctrines from church history. . . . The reader's theological understanding of Acts is enriched by Pelikan's successful effort to place Acts in theological conversation with centuries of Christian creeds and other rules of faith."<br>--<b>John B. Weaver</b>, <i>Calvin Theological Journal<br><br></i>"Jaroslav Pelikan is a good choice to help launch a series like this. He moves through the Acts of the Apostles, commenting astutely on the theological implications of key passages."<br>--<b>Donald Senior, CP</b>, <i>The Bible Today<br><br></i>"The comments that Pelikan has to offer on each point [in <i>Acts</i>] are truly valuable, insightful, and clearly articulated, a masterful treatment from a true master of his discipline. . . . [The series editors] have invited a diverse range of theologians and historians of theology to this project: We await with anticipation the wide range of offerings that are sure to emerge."<br>--<b>John Behr</b>, <i>Pro Ecclesia<br><br></i>"What's nice to see is that the individual commentators have been allowed to retain their own voices in this series; [in <i>Matthew</i>, Stanley] Hauerwas is as delightfully irascible and hard-hitting as ever. . . . Hauerwas attends to the Gospel chapter by chapter, teasing out theological themes while resisting the temptation to create a systematic Christology. He draws on theologians like Barth, Augustine, Origen and especially Bonhoeffer, whom he quotes and paraphrases often, as well as New Testament scholars and eclectic writers like Wendell Berry. Insightful and provocative, Hauerwas adds a valuable theological perspective to the Gospel of Matthew."<br>--<i>Publishers Weekly</i>The Brazos Theological Commentary on the Bible enlists leading theologians to read and interpret scripture for the twenty-first century, just as the church fathers, the Reformers, and other orthodox Christians did for their times and places. <i>Ezra &amp; Nehemiah</i> is the fourth volume in the series. This commentary, like each in the series, is designed to serve the church--through aid in preaching, teaching, study groups, and so forth--and demonstrate the continuing intellectual and practical viability of theological interpretation of the Bible.<br><br><b>Praise for previous volumes in the series<br><br></b>"The editors could not have found a more qualified person to probe the thick pages of the history of interpretation and Christian doctrine [in <i>Acts</i>].

Cunningham</b>, <i>America<br><br></i>"What Jaroslav Pelikan offers us [in <i>Acts</i>] . . . is neither a commentary nor a book of homilies, but rather a set of observations on what phrases and passages in Acts might remind us of in the later history of Christian doctrine.

In many churches today -- Catholic, Anglican, and others -- deacons have come to serve largely as servants of the poor and needy. In Deacons and the Church, Collins argues that this limited role for deacons was based on misinterpretations of key scriptural passages. Following the history of deacons in the Early Church to modern times, Collins offers extensive reflections on the relevant Scriptures, and suggests that we redefine the role of deacons for today. Rather than limit the role of deacons, he urges the church to adapt ancient meanings to modern pastoral situations. In the words of Ignatius of Antioch, whom he quotes in the final chapter, "Deacons are not providers of bread and drink but are agents of the congregation." <p>Collins paints a rich picture of deacons as agents of the church, ordained to the service of the bishop, who sends them forth as ministers of the church as a whole, rather than simply social workers. Collins provides an understanding of deacons that embraces social welfare but is not bound by it.</p></p><p>John N.

You can visit them at www.creativefilmmaking.com.<b>Introduction</b><br><br>This is a book about the creative process of filmmaking -- the mysterious transformation of mere glimmers of thought into coherent stories, characters, images and sounds. As filmmakers ourselves and as teachers of film and video production at the University of Southern California, we are passionate about films and fascinated by the challenges of making them well (we use the word "film" in this book to include all story-based moving image media). Inevitably, we have written a book shaped by our own tastes -- we're drawn to films that feel fresh, multilayered and authentic, that bear the distinct imprints of the people who made them, and that have a strong impact on audiences who see them. These are qualities that can be hard to pin down, but we sorely feel their absence in those films that seem to have come off an assembly line: hollow-feeling cut-and-paste pastiches of other movies and TV shows, filled with clich�d characters, cookie-cutter plots, hackneyed dialogue and imitative stylistic flourishes.<br><br>We have written this book to be appropriate for those learning filmmaking on their own as well as for students in a production class or program. We teach in a film school and see its great value in providing structure, contact with diverse tastes and approaches, a collaborative environment, a wide range of hands-on experience, faculty mentoring and many other benefits. We're also aware that film school is not for everyone and that many outstanding filmmakers never went to film school, including a majority of those interviewed for this book. We have therefore tried to make this a resource that would be informative and inspiring, whether used by an individual reader or as an assigned text in a course. (Teachers using this book in classes and workshops, as well as individual readers, may wish to refer to our website, creativefilmmaking.com, for additional suggestions.) Although we designed the book with developing filmmakers foremost in mind, the aspects of creativity it highlights and clarifies are ones that even the most experienced professionals continue to explore throughout their careers. We wrote a book that we ourselves learned a great deal from, and we believe that it will have rewards for anyone working in the field.<br><br>It's often said that no one sets out to make a bad film. So, assuming you share something of our taste and want to make films that are inspired, original and resonant, what's the foolproof, surefire formula for great filmmaking? Of course, there is no such thing. Paint-by-numbers formulas -- "put a plot point on page 'x' of the screenplay, use lens 'y' and camera move 'z' for shooting a certain kind of scene" -- cannot produce the kind of inventive, surprising filmmaking we admire. Doing good work is always a risky, unpredictable, paradoxical process even for the very best filmmakers. We used the word "mysterious" above to describe the creative process of filmmaking; so it is and so it shall remain.<br><br>Yet what you <i>can</i> learn, and what we emphasize in this book, is how best to prepare yourself, and how to approach your work, so that your inherent creativity has the greatest opportunity to emerge and flourish. <i>Creative Filmmaking from the Inside Out</i> describes an approach that begins with preparation that is largely individual and internal -- recognizing and strengthening your own unique point of view. As you learn to rely on rather than suppress your passions, idiosyncrasies, intuitive responses, values and personal connections to the material, you will develop a more confident inner voice. You can then bring that clarity to your collaborations with fellow filmmakers, to interpreting the responses of audiences, and to wrestling with your responsibilities as a creator of powerful art, without losing your way or diluting the integrity of your intent. Whatever the results, you will have a much better internal gauge for assessing and learning from each experience as you move on to your next creative project.<br><br>We have broken down the overall process described in <i>Creative Filmmaking from the Inside Out</i> into five chapters, each exploring one of what we call the "Five I's": <b>Introspection, Inquiry, Intuition, Interaction</b> and <b>Impact.</b> Although we had to put the chapters in a linear order, in reality the "Five I's" are all interwoven throughout the creative process. You might intersperse working from your own point of view (introspection) and brainstorming with a colleague (interaction). You may be in the middle of research (inquiry) and have a provocative dream (intuition). You may start with an idea of what a film is really about (impact), but find that your idea changes and develops throughout the filmmaking process.<br><br>The book begins with <b>Introspection,</b> a consideration of how the act of looking within ourselves can help us draw on who we are and how we see the world. The chapter looks at how we might discover the specific kind of work we have a passion for and are particularly well-suited to do; the importance of seeking personal connections in the material we choose to work on; and how we can reference and draw on our own specific experiences, including the darker, more difficult aspects of our lives, weaving bits of ourselves into what we create in order to deepen our sense of connection and authorship.<br><br>In addition to working from our own experience, we need as filmmakers to be able to draw on the entire spectrum of human thought and behavior, including those facets we have not yet directly encountered. In <b>Inquiry,</b> we see the importance of having a broad knowledge of the other arts and diverse fields of knowledge; the value of seeking direct firsthand experience of the world of a story; and the need for research, looking deeply into a subject, a setting, a culture, or an era in a way that enriches our understanding and point of view.<br><br>Our strange, elusive communications with the nonconscious parts of our mind are often the most spontaneously creative. <b>Intuition</b> is neither guesswork nor supernatural insight -- it is dependable in proportion to the extent that we have prepared ourselves well through education, observation, research and life experience. We can strengthen our receptiveness to our nonconscious inventiveness by connecting more deeply to our ability to dream, daydream, and become lost in play. Intuitive creativity can even require that we turn our conscious attention entirely away from our work for a while, as part of a problem-solving process.<br><br>Film is a profoundly collaborative art, and through <b>Interaction</b> we can draw effectively on the ideas and responses of others. Our filmmakers show how collaboration can be an open, fluid process that allows for the integration of many voices, with the director serving as the orchestrator of these varied contributions. When "creative differences" emerge, the resultant give-and-take can enhance rather than derail the process. Much of the success of interaction depends on establishing a genuinely open creative environment, insulated as much as possible from outside commercial forces.<br><br>In the fifth chapter, we look at how we create films that have an <b>Impact</b> on an audience. We see how discovering the deeper layers of a film -- its "undercurrent" -- can guide us in making choices that give a film power, resonance and universality. We also see how filmmakers use test audiences as part of the creative process, gauging if a film is having its desired impact. Finally, we explore how the powerful effect of films on audiences also brings with it complex questions of responsibility for the images we create, leading us back to introspection.<br><br>At the end of each chapter we include numerous practical yet playful <b>Limbering Up</b> explorations to stimulate and enhance creativity. These <i>limberings</i> are just that -- ways to loosen up and get your creative juices flowing. Most can be done in five minutes or less, and all are appropriate no matter what kind of work you are doing, anytime you want to get your head into a more innovative place.<br><br>The structure of the <b>Workout</b> section at the end of the book, by contrast, follows the specific tasks and various stages of the production process, from originating ideas and writing ("Down on the Page"), through pre-production and production ("Into the Can"), and post-production and audience response ("Up on the Screen"). This final section gives you explorations of greater depth that will connect to any current film project you may be working on.<br><br>Good filmmaking is passionate and risk-taking. Throughout this book, we encourage a certain level of conscious self-awareness and intentionality in filmmaking, but the probing and thoughtful explorations we describe are antithetical to approaches that over-systematize or over-intellectualize the essential emotionality and unpredictability of art. Intuitive leaps, serendipitous discoveries, continual exploration and surprise, and even long-after-the-fact realizations are all part of the mystery of the best creative work. The ultimate goal of this book is to help you attune your mind to the unexpected truths of your heart and gut.<br><br>Our own understanding of this process has come from more than thirty-five years of collective experience as teachers and mentors for literally thousands of student productions, and is also grounded in our work as active professional filmmakers -- writers, producers, directors and editors of both fiction and documentary films.<br><br>For this book, we sought to enlarge our perspective by going to the best sources possible: professional filmmakers whose work has been acclaimed for its originality and authenticity. We talked at length with fifteen outstanding filmmakers who have held key creative positions on some of the most beloved and highly regarded movies and television programs of our time: <i>American Beauty, Apocalypse Now, Boys Don't Cry, The English Patient, ER, Into the Arms of Strangers, L.A. Confidential, Picket Fences, The Remains of the Day, The Right Stuff, The Sixth Sense, Toy Story, The West Wing</i> and many others.<br><br>Although these professionals had been interviewed many times before, we set out to get a different perspective, choosing not to cover such familiar ground as working with movie stars, the technology of special effects, or anecdotal production stories ("ten straight days of rain"). Instead, we asked them to focus on their own creative process, and to give us concrete examples of why they approached specific scenes, sequences, characters, locations, and visual, sound or music motifs in the way they did.<br><br>Another way this book is unique is that everything in it is applicable to every creative role at every stage of the filmmaking process. We sought universal aspects of creativity that will be meaningful to you whether you are looking for a story idea, choosing a location, casting an actor, deciding where to place the camera, making an edit, or selecting a music cue. To achieve this level of universality, we interviewed a wide range of creators, both in terms of their professional position and their area of the industry. Writer Hanif Kureishi, writer-director Anthony Minghella, writer-director Kimberly Peirce, producer Ismail Merchant, production designer Jeannine Oppewall, cinematographer Conrad Hall, editor Lisa Fruchtman, sound designer and film editor Walter Murch and composer James Newton Howard have all worked primarily in live-action features, and writer-producer-director John Lasseter is known for feature animation. Writer-producer John Wells, writer Pamela Douglas, and actor Kathy Baker have worked extensively in television. Director-producer Renee Tajima-Pe�a and editor Kate Amend have specialized in documentary filmmaking. They are all introduced in <b>The Filmmakers,</b> and their major credits and awards are listed in <b>Selected Filmographies.</b> We also wanted to represent the continuing emergence of a greater diversity of filmmakers in terms of gender, ethnicity and sexual orientation (although the Hollywood studios are lagging badly in this regard), as well as include voices with a more international perspective.<br><br>In addition to their remarkable range of background and experience, why did we choose this particular group of filmmakers? We believe they exemplify the honest and deep creativity we are attempting to describe and promote. And while there is no definitive measure of what constitutes "good" filmmaking -- tastes vary widely and also change over time -- we sought those who are widely acclaimed at the top of their professions, and whose work has been recognized by the major critics' associations, their respective guilds and the Television and Motion Picture Academies. As a group, they have won or been nominated for thirty-nine Oscars and twenty-seven Emmys.<br><br>Finally, we looked for filmmakers who are passionate and enthusiastic. There are, of course, filmmakers who willingly embrace the often dismal commercialism and synthetic filmmaking that seems to dominate Hollywood. And there are others who are deeply cynical or bitter in their attitudes, defeated by the obstacles that challenge anyone who seeks to preserve their sense of integrity in a world of bottom-line thinking. Although all our filmmakers have had their share of frustrations, doubts and disappointments, by and large they are role models for the possibility of establishing successful careers, in many cases entirely within the Hollywood mainstream, while keeping to the priorities of artistry and authenticity.<br><br>Indeed, central to this book is the belief that developing one's creativity can be both personally satisfying and at the same time a practical means to professional success. In our experience and observations, even the most mainstream parts of the entertainment industry are hungry for people who are genuinely creative. Once hired, it's true, such people are likely to encounter pressure to be more formulaic and clich�d. But the more they have learned to work from their own distinctive taste and point of view, the better they will be able to hold on to those qualities through all the stages and pressures of the production process. And when fresh, innovative filmmaking does reach the theatrical or television screen, it usually makes the responsible filmmakers very much in demand.<br><br>Although we are coauthoring this book as longtime friends and teaching colleagues, we are three quite different individuals and have our own points of view and distinct professional filmmaking experiences to draw on: Carroll in independent feature filmmaking, Doe in media designed to promote and encourage social change in developing countries, and Jed in behind-the-scenes programs about Hollywood productions. Because all our varied experiences as filmmakers, teachers, workshop leaders and in our personal lives have shaped our views, we try to reference in the book what we have individually observed and learned. It is a challenge to have three authors and yet write in the personal tone we prefer. We try, in effect, to become three additional "characters" -- Carroll, Doe and Jed -- in this story of creative filmmaking from the inside out, mixing our own examples with those of the filmmakers we interviewed in the pages to follow.<br><br>Copyright � 2003 by Jed Dannenbaum, Carroll Hodge and Doe Mayer</p><h2>10.

Eagleton partners up with Marx, Nietzsche, Freud and Wittgenstein to awaken us to the materialism we already live, to which we have always already committed, in our embodied practices. We thereby come to see how the natural history of our forms of life implicates us in a creaturely solidarity with one another, the elaboration of which constitutes the conflict-ridden realm of politics. Eagleton&#x2019;s uncommonly luminous prose holds out the promise that a genuinely common life &#x2013; call it ordinary life &#x2013; for creatures such as us might yet be achievable."&#x2014;Eric L.

Eight of the nine pieces included here are published for the first time, and their range is characteristically wide: the subjects explored include realism in history; judgement in politics; the history of socialism; the nature and impact of Marxism; the radical cultural revolution instigated by the Romantics; Russian notions of artistic commitment; and the origins and practice of nationalism. The title essay, starting from the impossibility of historians being able to recreate a bygone epoch, is a superb centerpiece.</p></p><p>The publication of a new book by Sir Isaiah Berlin is always a welcome thing, and <i>The Sense of Reality</i> is no exception. In this volume the eminent scholar gathers nine long essays, eight previously unpublished, on the ideas that have governed European history for the last three centuries: nationalism, liberalism, and especially Marxism. Always seeking to draw moral lessons, Berlin wonders aloud why it is that humans admire men stirred by the lust for power or jealousy of others, or monomaniacal vanity--including notable figures of history like Peter the Great and Napoleon. He proposes a few answers in this study of ideas brought to power, and those answers are always illuminating.<p><b>Sir Isaiah Berlin</b> was born in Riga, Latvia, in 1909 and immigrated to England in 1921. Berlin's achievement as a historian and exponent of ideas earned him the Erasmus, Lippincott, and Agnelli Prizes. He also received the Jerusalem Prize for his lifelong defense of civil liberties. A Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, he was the author of ten other books. Sir Isaiah died in Oxford in November 1997.</p></p><h2>House of Trelawney: A novel</h2><p><b><b>From the author of </b><b><i>The Improbability of Love</i></b><b>: a dazzling novel both satirical and moving, about an eccentric, dysfunctional family of English aristocrats, and their crumbling stately home that reminds us how the lives and hopes of women can still be shaped by the ties of family and love.</b></b><br><br>For more than 700 years, the vast, rambling Trelawney Castle in Cornwall--turrets, follies, a room for every day of the year, four miles of corridors and 500,000 acres--was the magnificent and grand "three dimensional calling card" of the Earls of Trelawney. By 2008, it is in a complete state of ruin due to the dulled ambition and the financial ineptitude of the twenty-four earls, two world wars, the Wall Street crash, and inheritance taxes. Still: the heir to all of it, Kitto, his wife Jane, their three children, their dog, Kitto's ancient parents, and his aunt Tuffy Scott, an entomologist who studies fleas, all manage to live there and keep it going. Three women dominate the story: Jane; Kitto's sister, the spinster, Blaze, who left Trelawney and made a killing in finance in London, and the wildly beautiful, seductive, and long-ago banished Anastasia whose 19 year old daughter, Ayesha-- a complete replica of her mother--arrives unannounced at Trelawney. When Ayesha marries very well and buys the house to avenge her mother's memory, she makes Blaze's plan to save Trelawney completely unnecessary. But both Blaze and Jane are about to discover that the house itself is really only a very small part of what keeps the family together.</p><p>HANNAH ROTHSCHILD is the author of <i>The Improbability of Love</i> and <i>The Baroness: The Search for Nica, the Rebellious Rothschild. </i>She is also a film director whose documentaries have appeared at such festivals as Telluride and Tribeca.

Confessions of a Nazi Spy, starring Edward G. Robinson, told the story of German agents in New York City working to overthrow the U.S. government. The film alerted Americans to the dangers of Nazism at home and encouraged them to defend against it.</p><p>Confessions of a Nazi Spy may have been the first cinematic shot fired by Hollywood against Nazis in America, but it by no means marked the political awakening of the film industry&#x2019;s Jewish executives to the problem. Hollywood&#x2019;s Spies tells the remarkable story of the Jewish moguls in Hollywood who paid private investigators to infiltrate Nazi groups operating in Los Angeles, establishing the first anti-Nazi Jewish resistance organization in the country&#x2014;the Los Angeles Jewish Community Committee (LAJCC).</p><p>Drawing on more than 15,000 pages of archival documents, Laura B. Rosenzweig offers a compelling narrative illuminating the role that Jewish Americans played in combating insurgent Nazism in the United States in the 1930s. Forced undercover by the anti-Semitic climate of the decade, the LAJCC partnered with organizations whose Americanism was unimpeachable, such as the American Legion, to channel information regarding seditious Nazi plots to Congress, the Justice Department, the FBI and the Los Angeles Police Department.</p><p>Hollywood&#x2019;s Spies corrects the decades-long belief that American Jews lacked the political organization and leadership to assert their political interests during this period in our history and reveals that the LAJCC was one of many covert "fact finding" operations funded by Jewish Americans designed to root out Nazism in the United States.</p></p><p><b>Laura B.

(<i>The Washington Book Review</i>)<br><br>"Expertly mining a previously unexplored treasure trove of covert reports, Laura Rosenzweigs carefully researched monograph sheds new light on Berlin-sponsored pro-Nazi activity in America and on the daring defense work of one American Jewish organization in response to that activity. Rosenzweig carefully documents the Los Angeles Jewish Community Committees extensive undercover surveillance of hostile groups in Southern California and provides a brilliant analysis of its impact on national perceptions of the domestic pro-Nazi menace. Demonstrating the active role of Jewish Hollywood moguls and detailing the cloak-and-dagger exploits of individual informants, Rosenzweig adds a new dimension to our understanding of American Jewish responses to domestic antisemitism."

Nonevangelical people who follow the news may have a variety of impressions about what &#x201c;evangelical&#x201d; means. But one certain association they make with evangelicals is white Republicans. Many may recall that 81 percent of self-described white evangelicals voted for Donald Trump, and they may well wonder at the seeming hypocrisy of doing so.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this illuminating book, Thomas Kidd draws on his expertise in American religious history to retrace the arc of this spiritual movement, illustrating just how historically peculiar that political and ethnic definition (white Republican) of evangelicals is. He examines distortions in the public understanding of evangelicals, and shows how a group of &#x201c;Republican insider evangelicals&#x201d; aided the politicization of the movement. This book will be a must-read for those trying to better understand the shifting religious and political landscape of America today.</p><p><b>Thomas S.

His books include <i>Benjamin Franklin: The Religious Life of a Founding Father</i> and <i>American Colonial History: Clashing Cultures and Faiths</i>.&#x201c;How 81 percent of evangelicals could have voted for Donald Trump, given his flouting of their &#x2018;traditional values,&#x2019; has been a question for many Americans since 2016. . . .

Noll, co-editor of&nbsp;<i>Evangelicals: Who They Have Been, Are Now, and Could Be</i><br>&#x201c;Thomas Kidd, an accomplished U.S. historian and practicing evangelical Christian, reminds us that evangelicalism has always been primarily a religious and spiritual movement that, when at its best, has transcended race, class, ethnicity, and politics.&#x201d;&#x2014;John Fea, author of <i>Believe Me: The Evangelical Road to Donald Trump</i><br>&#x201c;Part history, part lament, this book offers a bracing introduction to evangelicalism in America. Thomas Kidd tells the tumultuous story of a movement that began in the eighteenth century as a heartfelt quest for spiritual rebirth and holiness, but which is best known today for its political support of Donald Trump and the Republican Party.&#x201d;&#x2014;Catherine A. Brekus, author of <i>Sarah Osborn&#x2019;s World</i><br>&#x201c;Learned but highly accessible, this is an excellent introduction to US evangelical history and politics.

In this timely volume, Beata Grant shows us that women masters do exist&#x2014;and have always existed.<br> <br> <i>Zen Echoes</i> is a collection of classic koans from Zen&#x2019;s Chinese history that were first collected and commented on by Miaozong, a twelfth-century nun so adept that her teacher, the legendary Dahui Zonggao, used to tell other students that perhaps if they practiced hard enough, they might be as realized as her. Nearly five hundred years later, the seventeenth-century nuns Baochi and Zukui added their own commentaries to the collection. The three voices&#x2014;distinct yet harmonious&#x2014;remind us that enlightenment&nbsp;is at once&nbsp;universal and individual.<br> <br> In her introduction to this shimmering translation, Professor Grant tells us that the verses composed by these women provide evidence that &#x201c;in a religious milieu made up overwhelmingly of men, there were women who were just as dedicated to Chan practice, just as advanced in their spiritual realization, and just as gifted at using language to convey that which is beyond language.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Beata Grant</b> is professor&nbsp;of Chinese and Religious Studies (Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures) at Washington University. She lives in St. Louis, Missouri.&#x201c;<i>Zen Echoes</i>&nbsp;is an exquisite book reflecting the power of the female voice in Zen.&#x201d; Author: Joan Jiko Halifax, abbot, Upaya Zen Center<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Zen Echoes</i> is a valuable and unique addition to the growing literature, in English, of Ch'an. Beata Grant has done a thorough and masterful job of clear translation, with plenty of notes to explain the many references, of forty-three Zen koans (some familiar, many important, but not so familiar) with verse commentaries by three women Ch'an masters. As Grant points out, there isn&#x2019;t anything feminist or even &#x201c;female&#x201d; about those verses. They are simply brilliant poetic teachings, from Ch'an's most developed eras, by three great masters who happen to be women. A text to ponder and savor.&#x201d; Author: Norman Fischer, author of What Is Zen?<br><br>&#x201c;A critical and unreservedly recommended addition to personal, community, and academic library Zen Buddhism collections and supplemental studies reading lists.&#x201d; Source: Midwest Book Review<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;With her exquisite translation, Grant offers us a precious gift, the koan commentaries of three female Zen Masters. As Westerners immerse themselves in studying and practicing Zen Buddhism, we need to add both the fact and substance of the female ancestors&#x2014;previously thought to be non-existent&#x2014;and move beyond Zen understanding based solely on patriarchal teachings. In Grant&#x2019;s work, we hear the vivid and embodied teachings of two women Zen Masters, relating to and commenting on an earlier distinguished women Zen master. When Baochi demands: &#x201c;<i>My breast surges with hot blood; can anyone understand this</i>?&#x201d; Grant leads us closer to answering Baochi, by intimately exposing the warm Zen heart of its female ancestors.&#x201d; Author: Grace Schireson, author of Zen Women<br><br>&#x201c;This is a wonderful and highly readable translation of a previously overlooked but extremely important collection of verse comments on several dozen koan cases by three eminent female Chinese Chan masters, who interacted creatively&nbsp;with male counterparts. In Beata Grant's capable hands, various&nbsp;Dharma battles involving traditional stories with questions and answers that are&nbsp;given original poetic interpretations come to life for the reader. <i>Zen Echoes</i> is an instant classic that illuminates the rich fields of Buddhist literature and cultural history, as well&nbsp;as&nbsp;studies of women's roles in East Asian religion.&#x201d; Author: Steven Heine, Florida International University<br><br>&#x201c;I deeply appreciate Beata Grant&#x2019;s work on translation of the three Chinese women Zen masters. This is a wonderful addition to the Zen literature available in English. 12th century Zen Master Miaozong said in her verse commentary on the famous koan &#x2018;The World-Honored One Ascends the Seat,&#x2019; &#x201c;The prison gates shatter into a hundred bits and pieces.&#x201d; We are able to be released from our self-made prison by studying and practicing following them.&#x201d; Author: Shohaku Okumura, author of Realizing Genjokoan</p><h2>Traditional Mexican Style Interiors (Schiffer Design Book)</h2><p>There is charm and character in a Mexican home like no other architectural style.

During her trips to Mexico researching Popular Arts of Mexico 1850-1950, she was continually exposed to not only Mexico&#x2019;s arts, but the country&#x2019;s architecture as well. This constant barrage of intense color, talavera tiles, lavish gardens, and relaxing portales left an indelible impression on McMenamin. So much so, she acted as general contractor for the couple&#x2019;s new Mexican style home in Tucson, Arizona which she shares with her husband, David and their two cats. McMenamin buys and sells antique Mexican and Native American Arts, accompanies clients to Mexico to shop for appropriate architectural details, and is a contributing writer for Tucson Lifestyle Magazine, Home &amp; Garden. Donna is also the founding President of Latin American Art Patrons, affiliated with the Tucson Museum of Art. </p><p>The Photographer </p><p>After graduating from Ohio University in 1983, with a BFA in photography, Richard Loper chose Houston, Texas, with its thriving oil business, to launch his photography career. He freelanced for local advertising agencies, graphic designers, magazines, and energy companies. However, the late eighties marked a slowdown in Houston&#x2019;s economy and Richard began dabbling in his other passion&#x2014;building custom furniture. In 1993, he embarked on his new career as a craftsman of fine reproduction Arts &amp; Crafts style furniture.His first collaboration with Donna McMenamin was Popular Arts of Mexico 1850-1950, for which he received rave reviews for his photography. Richard and his wife, Linda, recently purchased a 1926 Arts &amp; Crafts Bungalow with a long-term plan for renovating and refurbishing it.</p></p><h2>How to Attain Enlightenment: The Vision of Nonduality</h2><p>This complete guide to enlightenment presents the wisdom of the ancient science of self-inquiry, a time-tested means for achieving spiritual freedom. The author convincingly refutes the popular view that enlightenment is a unique state of consciousness and debunks a host of other myths. In his straightforward style he reveals proven methods for purifying the mind, and takes the reader from the beginning to the end of the spiritual path, patiently unfolding the logic of self-inquiry.</p><p>James Swartz grew up in Montana and attended Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin and the University of California at Berkeley before finding his niche in the world of business. He saw great success as a businessman, but in 1967 he experienced a major epiphany that turned him away from that path. Instead, he traveled to India on a spiritual journey, searching for the path to enlightenment. It was here that he learned of the famous Indian sage Swami Chinmayananda, whose knowledge and teachings proved to be the means to set James free. Now a disciple of the sage, James travels extensively to cities in America, Europe and India to hold seminars on Vedanta, the science of self-inquiry. He provides resources for understanding non-duality through his website, <i>ShiningWorld.com</i>.The Vision of Nonduality explains methods of Vedanta in his survey of spiritual techniques, pairing theory with practice and explaining the myths and realities behind an enlightened state. From reflections on moving to a larger living space and clutter to assimilating experiences, How to Attain Enlightenment is a powerful survey any new age library needs.<br> (<i>The Bookwatch, May 21, 2010</i>)<br><br>How to Attain Enlightenment explains and focuses on Vedanta, the science of self-inquiry, and considers the myths behind the state of enlightenment and its connections to happiness. The ancient teachings of Vedanta form a foundation of knowledge and practice that has questioned the nature of reality itself, and this survey of love, lifestyle, experience and more offers a fine survey perfect for new age libraries.<br><br> (<i>Midwest Book Review</i>)<br><br>Though based on the ancient wisdom and knowledge of Vedanta, it comes as a breath of fresh air. A biased outlook may regard this information as old and musty, but the modern perspective displays a new approach to this gleaming and invaluable treasure. <br><br>Any worldly and material knowledge is incomplete, for it is merely a minuscule part of the whole Universe. But self-knowledge, which emphasizes oneness and the non-dual, presents knowledge which is complete and whole. <br><br>This book goes through the entire gamut of topics covered by the Vedas, making use of yoga, detachment, the ego, karma, dharma, love, meditation and much more, to bring about an inner growth, wherein is visible the enlightened and luminous self.<br> (<i>East and West Magazine</i>)<br><br>Sentient Publications presents its next best-seller, How to Attain Enlightenment:The Vision of Nonduality by acclaimed author James Schwartz, who offers his ample wisdom on the ancient teachings of 'Vedanta.' <br><br>In Hinduism, Vedanta is a system of philosophy that further develops the connotation in the philosophies that add to the theology of ancient Hinduism. <br><br>In his first chapter, Inquiry into Object Happiness Schwartz holds the key to what it means to discover enlightenment... rather, a higher sense of awareness and consciousness to receive guidance and be in unison with the power of the Universe: <br><br>'What we call reality is governed by the uncertainly principle,' writes Schwartz, 'Because our source of food, animal or vegetable, is unconcerned about our need to survive, we are forced to either pursue it or cultivate it. Shelter does not simply happen on its own but requires effort to obtain.' The same principle holds true in what he further elaborates that even when material needs have been met, individuals often find that they are still not completely fulfilled or satisfied in their lives&#x2014;this is where having and maintaining a state of Vedanta helps soul seekers to be at one with the self and with the Universe, regardless of life circumstances. <br><br>If you are on a quest for wisdom and are ready to manifest a heightened state of consciousness so that you can become liberated and freed from the limitations that negate your personal and spiritual happiness, then gain the knowledge you need that Schwartz offers in his book How to Attain Enlightenment through a vast array of teachings, meditations, and more.<br> (<i>CarolAnnB</i>)<br><br>Would you like to learn how to attain enlightenment? Well regardless of the semantics of whether enlightenment is something to be attained, welcome to the enlightenmentdudes.com review of How to Attain Enlightenment by James Swartz. <br><br>This really is a handbook of enlightenment. He covers what enlightenment is not, such as not an experiential state, and then gets into what enlightenment is. He talks about qualifications, or a background of spiritual maturity the seeker needs to have. And he explains what self inquiry really is. <br><br>Swartz also spends time debunking enlightenment myths and exposing the inaccuracy of the teachings of neo-advaita (primarily western) instant enlightenment spiritual teachers. <br><br>The book reminded me of how it is to enter a relationship. It started off well, but then you reach a point where you ask yourself whether you want to go on. There was a period where I was wondering what kind of point he was trying to make and if it was actually going anywhere. Like weathering a relationship through the tough times, I went on, and I&#x2019;m glad it did. <br><br>Swartz is very funny in parts of the book, and it was refreshing to see a guy write in a fashion that uses descriptive terms that don&#x2019;t have you reading the words consciousness, awareness or pure being in every paragraph. There are too many spiritual books full of that crap, and Swartz is a very pleasant departure from that. <br><br>The writer has a very keen understanding of self inquiry and other methods on the spiritual path, and he discusses the benefits of each. Swartz spent considerable time in India learning self-inquiry and has a chapter dedicated to questions about Ramana Maharshi. Swartz&#x2019;s teacher was not a Ramana follower so there are areas where he differentiates from Ramana. He also discusses how one&#x2019;s lifestyle has a major impact on enlightenment and he differentiates terms awakening and enlightenment as being two different things. <br><br>Overall, if you can get through the slow parts, this is an excellent and comprehensive book.

But despite his lasting legacy, Richard only ruled as king for the final two years of his life. While much attention has been given to his short reign, Michael Hicks explores the whole of Richard&#x2019;s fascinating life and traces the unfolding of his character and career from his early years as the son of a duke to his violent death at the battle of Bosworth.<br><br> Hicks explores how Richard&#x2014;villainized for his imprisonment and probable killing of the princes&#x2014;applied his experience to overcome numerous setbacks and adversaries. Richard proves a complex, conflicted individual whose Machiavellian tact and strategic foresight won him a kingdom. He was a reformer who planned big changes, but lost the opportunity to fulfill them and to retain his crown.</p><p><b>Michael Hicks </b>is Emeritus Professor of Medieval History at the University of Winchester and has been described as "the greatest living expert on Richard" by <i>BBC History Magazine. </i>His previous publications include <i>The War of the Roses</i>.&#x201c;Hicks has thrown down the gauntlet.&nbsp; Never has&nbsp;Richard the man been more convincingly portrayed.

The U.S. learns that Iran has developed nuclear capability, and the president orders the Whiplash team, led by Breanna Stockard, to neutralize the threat. Stockard sends U.S. Air Force pilot Captain Turk Mako to sneak into the country and, with the help of drones, take out the nuke. But Mako quickly learns that there is more than one target, and the seemingly easy mission becomes a nightmare. This popular series boasts two veteran thriller writers who have produced terrific work solo and in tandem, but unfortunately, this time the narrative never quite gels. Iran and the nuclear threat have been done to death, and nothing in the story feels fresh.

She spent the last twelve as the madam of a moderately fancy brothel in Lincoln, Nebraska. After retiring in 1907 and moving to Omaha, she turned to "throwing a searchlight on the underworld," including the "cribs" of Nebraska&#x2019;s largest city. <i>The Underworld Sewer</i>, based on her own experience in the profession, blazes with a kind of honesty unavailable to more conventional moral reformers.&nbsp;Originally published in 1909, <i>The Underworld Sewer</i> asks why "the social evil" is universally considered necessary or inevitable. Washburn minces no words in exposing the conditions that perpetuate prostitution: the greed and graft of landlords, pimps, alcohol vendors, dope dealers, police officers, city administrators, and politicians; the competition for circulation by sensation-seeking newspapers; the indifference or intolerance of law-abiding, church-going citizens; the false modesty that prevents family discussion of venereal disease; the double standard that allows men to indulge their sexuality but punishes women who do so.</p><p>Sharon Wood is an assistant professor of history at the University of Chicago.</p><h2>The Accidental Further Adventures of the Hundred-Year-Old Man: A Novel</h2><p><p>The hysterical, clever, and unforgettable sequel to Jonas Jonasson&#x2019;s international bestseller <em>The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared.</em><em></em></p><p><strong>He's back.

In contrast to standard histories that counterpose the design philosophies of the Chicago and New York "schools," Willis shows how market formulas produced characteristic forms in each city"vernaculars of capitalism"that resulted from local land-use patterns, municipal codes, and zoning. Refuting some common clichs of skyscraper history such as the equation of big buildings with big business and the idea of a "corporate skyline," Willis emphasizes the importance of speculative development and the impact of real-estate cycles on the forms of buildings and on their spatial distribution.<p><i>Form Follows Finance</i> cautions that the city must be understood as a complex commercial environment where buildings are themselves businesses, space is a commodity, and location and image have value.</p></p><p>The central theme of this well researched history of architecture, urban planning, and real estate is that in the design of office buildings, form, space, and money are all intricately bound up with one another. This convincing hypothesis is presented in the form of a comprehensive and comparative look at the skylines of two major turn-of-the-century cities, which are also two of the most illustrious American metropolises: Chicago and New York. What differentiates this book from other histories of the skyscraper is its emphasis on economics as the chief factor in the determination of form, as well as on municipal codes, land-use patterns, and zoning. It is also an urban history and an agile investigation into the forces that shaped the tallest buildings in America. It is fascinating to learn, for instance, how new formal solutions for office buildings emerged, exactly how the height of the Empire State Building was determined, and how economics contributed to the vast majority of these and other design decisions.Carol Willis is founding director of the Skyscraper Museum in New York City.</p><h2>English Renaissance Poetry: A Collection of Shorter Poems from Skelton to Jonson (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p><b>AN ANTHOLOGY FROM THE AUTHOR OF <i>STONER</i></b><br><br>Poetry in English as we know it was largely invented in England between the early 1500s and 1630, and yet for many years the poetry of the era was considered little more than a run-up to Shakespeare. The twentieth century brought a reevaluation, and the English Renaissance has since come to be recognized as the period of extraordinary poetic experimentation that it was. Never since have the possibilities of poetic form and, especially, poetic voice&#x2014;from the sublime to the scandalous and slangy&#x2014;been so various and inviting. This is poetry that speaks directly across the centuries to the renaissance of poetic exploration in our own time.<br><br>John Williams&#x2019;s celebrated anthology includes not only some of the most famous poems by some of the most famous poets of the English language (Sir Thomas Wyatt, John Donne, and of course Shakespeare) but also-&#x2014;-and this is what makes Williams&#x2019;s book such a rare and rich resource&#x2014;the strikingly original work of little-known masters like George Gascoigne and Fulke Greville.</p><p><b>John Williams</b> (1922&#x2013;1994) was born and raised in northeast Texas.

The Society is entirely free from educational, political, or ecclesiastical control. Dedicated to an idealistic approach to the solution of human problems, the Society&#39;s program stresses the need for the integration of religion, philosophy, and the science of psychology into one system of instruction. The goal of this instruction is to enable the individual to develop a mature philosophy of life, to recognize his proper responsibilities and opportunities, and to understand and appreciate his place in the unfolding universal pattern.Manly P. Hall was the founder of the Philosophical Research Society. In over seventy-five years of dynamic public activity, he delivered more than 8,000 lectures in the United States and abroad, and authored countless books, essays, and articles. In his lectures and writings, Manly Hall always emphasized the practical aspects of philosophy and religion as they applied to daily living. He restated for modern man those spiritual and ethical doctrines which have given humanity its noblest ideals and most adequate codes of conduct. Believing that philosophy is a working tool to help the individual in building a solid foundation for his dreams and purposes, Manly Hall steadfastly sought recognition of the belief that world civilization can be perfected only when human beings meet on a common ground of intelligence, cooperation, and worthy purpose.</p><h2>Hunter Brown and the Eye of Ends (Codebearers #3)</h2><p>In Hunter Brown and The Eye of Ends, the heart pounding conclusion of Hunters previous adventures begins with an even bigger surprise, his memory is gone.

It was the last of these, in Eve&#x2019;s mind, that had led one John Henry Bonning to throw one Charles Michael Renekee out a twelfth-story window on Avenue D.</p><p>She had Bonning in Interview and calculated that it would take another twenty minutes tops to shake a confession out of him, another fifteen to book him and file her report. She might just make it home on time.</p><p>&#x201c;Come on, Boner.&#x201d; It was her veteran cop talking to veteran bad guy. Level ground, her turf. &#x201c;Do yourself a favor.

All she had to do was keep him from saying those words, steer him in the direction she was already heading, and she had a wrap.</p><p>Second-rate chemi-dealers like Bonning were invariably slow-witted, but sooner or later he&#x2019;d whine for a representative. It was an old shuffle-and-dodge, as timeless as murder itself.

Pretty funny, Dallas.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, I&#x2019;m thinking of moonlighting as a stand-up. But, going back to my day job, the two of you were cooking up some Erotica in your porta-lab on Avenue D, and Renekee&#x2014;being a crazy bastard&#x2014;just got some hair up his ass and jumped out a window&#x2014;right through the glass&#x2014;and dived twelve stories, bounced off the roof of a Rapid Cab, scared the living shit out of a couple of tourists from Topeka in the backseat, then rolled off to leak his brains onto the street.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure did bounce,&#x201d; Bonning said with what passed for a wondering smile. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;da thought?&#x201d;</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t intend to go for murder one, and figured if she went for murder two the court-appointed rep would bargain Bonning down to manslaughter.

And even combining the two, it was doubtful he&#x2019;d do more than a three-year stretch in lockup.</p><p>She folded her arms on the table, leaned forward. &#x201c;Boner, do I look stupid?&#x201d;</p><p>Taking the question at face value, Bonning narrowed his eyes to take a careful study. She had big brown eyes, but they weren&#x2019;t soft. She had a pretty, wide mouth, but it didn&#x2019;t smile. &#x201c;Look like a cop,&#x201d; he decided.</p><p>&#x201c;Good answer. Don&#x2019;t try to hose me here, Boner. You and your business partner had a falling out, you got pissed off, and you terminated your professional and personal relationship by heaving his dumb ass out the window.&#x201d; She held up a hand before Bonning could deny again. &#x201c;This is the way I see it. You got into, maybe dissing each other over the profits, the methods, a woman. You both got hot. So maybe he comes at you. You&#x2019;ve got to defend yourself, right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Man&#x2019;s got a right,&#x201d; Bonning agreed, nodding rapidly as the story sang to him. &#x201c;But we didn&#x2019;t get into nothing. He just tried to fly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;d you get the bloody lip, the black eye? How come your knuckles are ripped up?&#x201d;</p><p>Bonning stretched his lips into a toothy grin. &#x201c;Bar fight.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;When? Where?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who remembers?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d better. And you know you&#x2019;d better, Boner, after we run the tests on the blood we scraped from your knuckles, and we find his blood mixed with yours. We get his DNA off your fat fingers, I&#x2019;m going for premeditated&#x2014;maximum lockup, life, no parole.&#x201d;</p><p>His eyes blinked rapidly, as if his brain was processing new and baffling data. &#x201c;Come on, Dallas, that&#x2019;s just bullshit. You ain&#x2019;t gonna convince nobody I walked in there thinking to kill old Chuckaroo. We were buds.&#x201d;</p><p>Her eyes steady on his, Eve pulled out her communicator. &#x201c;Last chance to help yourself. I call my aide, have her get the test results, I&#x2019;m booking you on murder one.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wasn&#x2019;t no murder.&#x201d; He wanted to believe she was bluffing. You couldn&#x2019;t read those eyes, he thought, wetting his lips. Couldn&#x2019;t read those cop&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;It was an accident,&#x201d; he claimed, inspired. Eve only shook her head. &#x201c;Yeah, we were busting a little and he&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. tripped and went headlong out the window.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Now you&#x2019;re insulting me. A grown man doesn&#x2019;t trip out a window that&#x2019;s three feet off the floor.&#x201d; Eve flicked on her communicator. &#x201c;Officer Peabody.&#x201d;</p><p>Within seconds Peabody&#x2019;s round and sober faced filled the communicator screen. &#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I need the blood test results on Bonning. Have them sent directly to Interview A&#x2014;and alert the PA that I have a murder in the first.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Now hold on, back up, don&#x2019;t be going there.&#x201d; Bonning ran the back of his hand over his mouth. He struggled a moment, telling himself she&#x2019;d never get him on the big one. But Dallas had a rep for pinning fatter moths than he to the wall.</p><p>&#x201c;You had your chance, Boner. Peabody&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He came at me, like you said. He came at me. He went crazy. I&#x2019;ll tell you how it went down, straight shit. I want to make a statement.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Peabody, delay those orders. Inform the PA that Mr. Bonning is making a statement of straight shit.&#x201d;</p><p>Peabody&#x2019;s lips never twitched. &#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>Eve slipped the communicator back in her pocket, then folded her hands on the edge of the table and smiled pleasantly. &#x201c;Okay, Boner, tell me how it went down.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fifty minutes later, Eve strolled into her tiny office in New York&#x2019;s Cop Central. She did look like a cop&#x2014;not just the weapon harness slung over her shoulder, the worn boots and faded jeans. Cop was in her eyes&#x2014;eyes that missed little. They were a dark whiskey color, and rarely flinched. Her face was angular, sharp at the cheekbones, and set off by a surprisingly generous mouth and a shallow dent in the chin.</p><p>She walked in a long-limbed, loose-gaited style&#x2014;she was in no hurry. Pleased with herself, she raked her fingers through her short, casually cropped brown hair as she sat behind her desk.</p><p>She would file her report, zing off copies to all necessary parties, then log out for the day. Outside the streaked and narrow window behind her, the commuter air traffic was already in a snarl. The blat of airbus horns and the endless snicking of traffic copter blades didn&#x2019;t bother her. It was, after all, one of the theme songs of New York.</p><p>&#x201c;Engage,&#x201d; she ordered, then hissed when her computer remained stubbornly blank. &#x201c;Damn it, don&#x2019;t start this. Engage. Turn on, you bastard.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to feed it your personal pass number,&#x201d; Peabody said as she stepped inside.</p><p>&#x201c;I thought these were back on voice ID.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Were. Snaffued. Supposed to be back up to speed by the end of the week.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pain in the butt,&#x201d; Eve complained. &#x201c;How many numbers are we supposed to remember? Two, five, zero, nine.&#x201d; She blew out a breath as her unit coughed to life. &#x201c;They&#x2019;d better come up with the new system they promised the department.&#x201d; She slipped a disc into the unit. &#x201c;Save to Bonning, John Henry, case number 4572077-H. Copy report to Whitney, Commander.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nice, quick work on Bonning, Dallas.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The man&#x2019;s got a brain the size of a pistachio. Tossed his partner out the window because they got into a fight over who owed who a stinking twenty credits. And he&#x2019;s trying to tell me he was defending himself, in fear for his life. The guy he tossed was a hundred pounds lighter and six inches shorter. Asshole,&#x201d; she said with a resigned sigh. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d have thought Boner would have cooked up the guy had a knife or swung a bat at him.&#x201d;</p><p>She sat back, circled her neck, surprised and pleased that there was barely any tension to be willed away. &#x201c;They should all be this easy.&#x201d;</p><p>She listened with half an ear to the hum and rumble of the early air traffic outside her window. One of the commuter trams was blasting out its spiel on economical rates and convenience.</p><p>&#x201c;Weekly, monthly, yearly terms available! Sign on to EZ TRAM, your friendly and reliable air transport service. Begin and end your work day in style.&#x201d;</p><p><i>If you like the packed-in-like-sweaty-sardines style,</i> Eve thought. With the chilly November rain that had been falling all day, she imagined both air and street snarls would be hideous. The perfect end to the day.</p><p>&#x201c;That wraps it,&#x201d; she said and grabbed her battered leather jacket. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m clocking out&#x2014;on time for a change. Any hot plans for the weekend, Peabody?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My usual, flicking off men like flies, breaking hearts, crushing souls.&#x201d;</p><p>Eve shot a quick grin at her aide&#x2019;s sober face. The sturdy Peabody, she thought&#x2014;a cop from the crown of her dark bowl-cut hair to her shiny regulation shoes. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re such a wild woman, Peabody. I don&#x2019;t know how you keep up the pace.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, that&#x2019;s me, queen of the party girls.&#x201d; With a dry smile, Peabody reached for the door just as Eve&#x2019;s tele-link beeped. Both of them scowled at the unit. &#x201c;Thirty seconds and we&#x2019;d have been on the skywalk down.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Probably just Roarke calling to remind me we&#x2019;ve got this dinner party deal tonight.&#x201d; Eve flicked the unit on. &#x201c;Homicide, Dallas.&#x201d;</p><p>The screen swam with colors, dark, ugly, clashing colors. Music, low octave, slow paced, crept out of the speaker. Automatically, Eve tapped the command for trace, watched the Unable to Comply message scroll across the bottom of the screen.</p><p>Peabody whipped out her porta-link, stepping aside to contact Central Control as the caller spoke.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re supposed to be the best the city has to offer, Lieutenant Dallas. Just how good are you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Unidentified contact and/or jammed transmissions to police officers are illegal. I&#x2019;m obliged to caution you that this transmission is being traced through CompuGuard, and it&#x2019;s being recorded.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m aware of that. Since I&#x2019;ve just committed what worldly society would consider first-degree murder, I&#x2019;m not overly concerned about minor nuisances like electronic violations. I&#x2019;ve been blessed by the Lord.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh yeah?&#x201d; Terrific, she thought, just what she needed.</p><p>&#x201c;I have been called on to do His work, and have washed myself in the blood of His enemy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Does He have a lot of them? I mean, you&#x2019;d think He&#x2019;d just, what, smite them down Himself instead of enlisting you to do the dirty work.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a pause, a long one, in which only the dirge played through. &#x201c;I have to expect you to be flippant.&#x201d; The voice was harder now, and edgier. Temper barely suppressed. &#x201c;As one of the godless, how could you understand divine retribution? I&#x2019;ll put this on your level. A riddle. Do you enjoy riddles, Lieutenant Dallas?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; She slid her gaze toward Peabody, got a quick, frustrated head shake. &#x201c;But I bet you do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They relax the mind and soothe the spirit. The name of this little riddle is Revenge. You&#x2019;ll find the first son of the old sod in the lap of luxury, atop his silver tower where the river runs dark below and water falls from a great height. He begged for his life, and then for his death. Never repenting his great sin, he is already damned.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why did you kill him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because this is the task I was born for,&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;God told you that you were born to kill?&#x201d; Eve pushed for trace again, fought with frustration. &#x201c;How&#x2019;d He let you know? Did He call you up on your &#x2019;link, send a fax? Maybe He met you in a bar?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You won&#x2019;t doubt me.&#x201d; The sound of breathing grew louder, strained, shaky. &#x201c;You think because you&#x2019;re a woman in a position of authority that I&#x2019;m less? You won&#x2019;t doubt me for much longer. I contacted you, Lieutenant. Remember this is in my charge. Woman may guide and comfort man, but man was created to protect, defend, to avenge.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;God tell you that too? I guess that proves He&#x2019;s a man after all. Mostly ego.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll tremble before Him, before me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, right.&#x201d; Hoping his video was clear, Eve examined her nails. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m already shaking.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My work is holy. It is terrible and divine. From Proverbs, Lieutenant, twenty-eight seventeen: &#x2018;If a man is burdened with the blood of another, let him be a fugitive until death; let no one help him.&#x2019; This one&#x2019;s days as a fugitive are done&#x2014;and no one helped him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If you killed him, what does that make you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The wrath of God. You have twenty-four hours to prove you&#x2019;re worthy. Don&#x2019;t disappoint me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t disappoint you, asshole,&#x201d; Eve muttered as the transmission ended. &#x201c;Anything, Peabody?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing. He jammed the tracers good and proper. They can&#x2019;t give us so much as on or off planet.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s on planet,&#x201d; she muttered and sat. &#x201c;He wants to be close enough to watch.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Could be a crank.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so. A fanatic, but not a crank. Computer, run buildings, residential and commercial with the word <i>luxury,</i> in New York City, with view of the East River or the Hudson.&#x201d; She tapped her fingers. &#x201c;I hate puzzle games.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I kind of like them.&#x201d; Brows knit, Peabody leaned over Eve&#x2019;s shoulder as the computer went to work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Luxury Arms<br>Sterling Luxury<br>Luxury Place<br>Luxury Towers</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eve pounced. &#x201c;Access visual of Luxury Towers, on screen.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Working&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The image popped, a towering spear of silver with a glint of sunlight off the steel and shimmering on the Hudson at its base. On the far west side, a stylish waterfall tumbled down a complex arrangement of tubes and channels.</p><p>&#x201c;Gotcha.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t be that easy,&#x201d; Peabody objected.</p><p>&#x201c;He wanted it easy.&#x201d; Because, Eve thought, someone was already dead. &#x201c;He wants to play and he wants to preen. Can&#x2019;t do either until we&#x2019;re in it. Computer, access name of residents on the top floor of the Luxury Towers.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Working&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

It comes from the Arabic al sayyid, master or chieftain, and seems to have been given to Rodrigo de Vivar by his Muslim foes. But was it given in recognition of El Cid's victories against Islam in the 'Reconquista' &#x2013; or because this Castilian nobleman was as content to serve beside the Muslims as to fight them? The story of the Christian conquest of the Iberian peninsula which gave rise to the legend of El Cid, is here examined by David Nicolle, who outlines the history, tactics, arms and armour of the period.</p><p>Packed with specially commissioned artwork, maps and diagrams, the Men-at-Arms series is an unrivalled illustrated reference on the history, organisation, uniforms and equipment of the world&#39;s military forces, past and present.David Nicolle PhD was born in 1944 and was educated at Highgate School.

It examines literature as a form of human action and argues that the reading and writing of literary works provide vital ways for men and women to act as responsible agents in God's world.</p><p>Building upon the doctrine of Creation, the authors show how the reading of literature helps us to be more effective interpreters of the stories and images we encounter daily.

When Lacey's fair-haired boy, Duncan Harper, is appointed interim sheriff, he makes public his private convictions about the equality of blacks before the law, and the combined threat and promise he represents to the understood order of things in Lacey affects almost every member of the community. In the end, Harper succeeds in pointing the way for individuals, both black and white, to find a more harmonious coexistence, but at a sacrifice all must come to regret.<br>In The Voice at the Back Door, Mississippi native Elizabeth Spencer gives form to the many voices that shaped her view of race relations while growing up, and at the same time discovers her own voice -- one of hope. Employing her extraordinary literary powers -- finely honed narrative techniques, insight into a rich, diverse cast of characters, and an unerring ear for dialect -- Spencer makes palpable the psychological milieu of a small southern town hobbled by tradition but lurching toward the dawn of the civil rights movement. First published in 1956, The Voice at the Back Door is Spencer's most highly praised novel yet, and her last to treat small-town life in Mississippi.</p></p><p><p>Elizabeth Spencer lives in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and has written eight other novels, including The Light in the Piazza, The Snare, The Salt Line and The Night Travellers.

Like her late husband, she works the gold mines much as the Indians were forced to do at the time of the Spanish Conquest. Illiteracy, malnutrition, and disease reign as they did five hundred years ago. And now, just as then, a miner&#x2019;s survival depends on a vast global market whose fluctuations are controlled in faraway places.<br> <br>Carlos Buergos is a Cuban who fought in the civil war in Angola and now lives in a quiet community outside New Orleans. He was among hundreds of criminals Cuba expelled to the US in 1980. His story echoes the violence that has coursed through the Americas since before Columbus to the crushing savagery of the Spanish Conquest, and from 19th- and 20th-century wars and revolutions to the military crackdowns that convulse Latin America to this day.<br> <br>Xavier Alb� is a Jesuit priest from Barcelona who emigrated to Bolivia, where he works among the indigenous people. He considers himself an Indian in head and heart and, for this, is well known in his adopted country. Although his aim is to learn rather than proselytize, he is an inheritor of a checkered past, where priests marched alongside conquistadors, converting the natives to Christianity, often forcibly, in the effort to win the New World. Ever since, the Catholic Church has played a central role in the political life of Latin America&#x2014;sometimes for good, sometimes not.<br> <br>In <i>Silver, Sword, and Stone</i> Marie Arana seamlessly weaves these stories with the history of the past millennium to explain three enduring themes that have defined Latin America since pre-Columbian times: the foreign greed for its mineral riches, an ingrained propensity to violence, and the abiding power of religion. What emerges is a vibrant portrait of a people whose lives are increasingly intertwined with our own.</p><p>Marie Arana was born in Lima, Peru. She is the author of the memoir <i>American Chica</i>, a finalist for the National Book Award; two novels, <i>Cellophane </i>and<i> Lima Nights</i>; and <i>The Writing Life</i>, a collection from her well-known column for <i>The Washington Post</i>. She lives in Washington, DC, and Lima, Peru.Silver, Sword, and Stone CHAPTER 1<p></p> STILL SEEKING EL DORADO<p></p> <br><br> <br>Peru is a beggar sitting on a bench of gold.<br> <br>&#x2014;Old Peruvian adage<br> <br>In the stinging cold just before dawn, Leonor Gonz�les leaves her stone hut on a glacial mountain peak in the Peruvian Andes to trudge up a path and scour rock spills for flecks of gold. Like generations before her, she has teetered under heavy bags of stone, pounded it with a crude hammer, ground it to gravel with her feet, crushed it to a fine sand. On rare, lucky days, she teases out infinitesimally small motes of gold by swirling the grit in a mercury solution. She is only forty-seven, but her teeth are gone. Her face is cooked by a relentless sun, parched by the freezing winds. Her hands are the color of cured meat, the fingers humped and gnarled. She is partially blind. But every day as the sun peeks over the icy promontory of Mount Ananea, she joins the women of La Rinconada, the highest human habitation in the world, to scale the steep escarpment that leads toward the mines, scavenging for all that shines, stuffing stones into the backbreaking rucksack she will lug down-mountain at dusk.<br> <br>It might be a scene from biblical times, but it is not. Leonor Gonz�les climbed that ridge yesterday during the pallaqueo, the hunt for gold her forebears have undertaken since time immemorial, and she will climb it again tomorrow, doing what she has done since she first accompanied her mother to work at the age of four. Never mind that a Canadian mining company less than thirty miles away is performing the same task more efficiently with hulking, twenty-first-century machinery; or that just beyond Lake Titicaca&#x2014;the cradle of Inca civilization&#x2014;Australian, Chinese, and United States corporate giants are investing millions for state-of-the-art equipment to join the Latin American mining bonanza. The business of digging deep into the earth&#x2019;s entrails to wrest glittering treasures has long, abiding roots on this continent and, in many ways, defines the people we Latin Americans have become.<br> <br>Leonor Gonz�les is the embodiment of &#x201c;silver, sword, and stone,&#x201d; the triad of this book&#x2019;s title&#x2014;three obsessions that have held Latin Americans fast for the past millennium. &#x201c;Silver&#x201d; is the lust for precious metals; the infatuation that rules Leonor&#x2019;s life as it has ruled generations before her: a frantic hunt for a prize she cannot use, a substance that is wanted in cities she will never see. The passion for gold and silver is an obsession that burned brightly before Columbus&#x2019;s time, consumed Spain in its relentless conquest of America, drove a cruel system of slavery and colonial exploitation, sparked a bloody revolution, addled the region&#x2019;s stability for centuries, and morphed into Latin America&#x2019;s best hope for the future. Just as Inca and Aztec rulers made silver and gold symbols of their glory, just as sixteenth-century Spain grew rich and powerful as the preeminent purveyor of precious metals, mining remains at the heart of the Latin American promise today. That obsession lives on&#x2014;the glistening troves extracted and sent away by the boatloads&#x2014;even though the quarries are finite. Even though the frenzy must end.<br> <br>Leonor is no less a product of &#x201c;silver&#x201d; than she is of the &#x201c;sword,&#x201d; Latin America&#x2019;s abiding culture of the strongman that accompanies it: the region&#x2019;s proclivity, as Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez, Jos� Mart�, Mario Vargas Llosa, and others have pointed out, to solve problems by unilateral and alarming displays of power. By brutality. By a reliance on muscle, coercion, and an overweening love for dictators and the military: la mano dura, the iron fist. Violence was certainly the easy expedient in the day of the war-loving Moche in AD 800, but it grew more so under the Aztec and Inca Empires, was perfected and institutionalized by Spain under the cruel tutelage of Cort�s and Pizarro, and became ingrained during the hellish wars of Latin American independence in the nineteenth century. State terrorism, dictatorships, endless revolutions, Argentina&#x2019;s Dirty War, Peru&#x2019;s Shining Path, Colombia&#x2019;s FARC, Mexico&#x2019;s crime cartels, and twenty-first-century drug wars are its legacies. The sword remains as much a Latin American instrument of authority and power as it ever was five hundred years ago when the Dominican friar Bartolom� de Las Casas lamented that the Spanish colonies were &#x201c;choak&#x2019;d up with Indian Blood and Gore.&#x201d;<br> <br>No, Leonor Gonz�les is no stranger to oppression and violence. Her ancestors, people of the altiplano, were conquered and forced into labor by the Incas and then reconquered and enslaved by Spanish conquistadors. For centuries, her people were relocated by force at the whims of the mitmaq&#x2014;the compulsory labor system that the Inca Empire, and then Spain, demanded of the vanquished. Or they were taken away in the Church&#x2019;s &#x201c;reductions&#x201d;: massive resettlements of indigenous populations in the ongoing enterprise to save their souls. In the nineteenth century, Leonor&#x2019;s people were herded at sword&#x2019;s point to fight and be sacrificed on opposing sides of the revolution. In the twentieth century, they were driven higher and higher into the snowy reaches of the Andes to escape the wanton massacres of the Shining Path. But even in that airless aerie, eighteen thousand feet above sea level, the sword has continued to be master. Today in the wild, lawless mining town of La Rinconada, where murder and rape are rampant&#x2014;where human sacrifices are offered to mountain demons and no government police chief dares go&#x2014;Leonor is as vulnerable to brute force as her forebears were five hundred years ago.<br> <br>Every day when she rises, Leonor touches a small, gray stone that she keeps on a ledge by her cot, near a faded photograph of her dead husband, Juan Sixto Ochochoque. Every night, before she crawls under a blanket with her children and grandchildren, she touches it again. &#x201c;His soul rests inside,&#x201d; she told me when I visited her in her frigid one-room hut, no larger than ten feet squared, where she lives on the lip of a mountain glacier with two sons, two daughters, and two grandchildren. She and Juan, the ruddy-faced miner in the photo, were never actually married; no one in Leonor&#x2019;s acquaintance has ever taken the Church&#x2019;s vows. To her, Juan is her husband and the father of her children; and, from the day a mine-shaft collapsed, and his lungs filled with the deadly fumes that killed him, that round, gray stone at the head of her bed has come to represent him even as it represents the whole of Leonor&#x2019;s spiritual life. Like many indigenous people&#x2014;from the Rio Grande to the Tierra del Fuego&#x2014;Leonor accepts Catholic teachings only as they reflect the gods of her ancestors. Virgin Mary is another face for Pachamama, Earth Mother, the ground beneath our feet, from which all bounty springs. God is another word for Apu, the spirit that dwells in mountains, whose energy comes from the sun and lives on in stones. Satan is Supay, a demanding rascal-god who rules death, the underworld, the dark entrails of ground below ground, and needs to be appeased.<br> <br>Leonor&#x2019;s stone stands for the third obsession that has held Latin America in its grip for the past thousand years: the region&#x2019;s fervent adherence to religious institutions, whether they be temples, churches, elaborate cathedrals, or piles of sacred rock. The first order of business when pre-Columbian powers conquered one another a thousand years ago was to pound the others&#x2019; gods to rubble. With the arrival of the conquistadors in the Americas, the triumphant monuments of stone erected by the Aztecs and the Incas to honor their gods were often reduced to mere pedestals for mighty cathedrals. The significance was not lost on the conquered. Rock was piled on rock, palaces were built on top of palaces, a church straddled every important indigenous temple or huaca, and religion became a powerful, concrete reminder of who had won the day. Even as time wore on&#x2014;even as Catholicism became the single most powerful institution in Latin America, even as some of its adherents began to be wooed away by Pentecostalism&#x2014;Latin Americans have remained a resolutely religious population. They cross themselves when they pass a church. They build shrines in their homes. They carry images of saints in their wallets, talk to their coca leaves, hang crosses from rearview mirrors, fill their pockets with sacred stones.<br> <br>Leonor is not alone in her thrall to silver, sword, and stone. The majority of Latin Americans are bound to her by no more than a few degrees of separation. Extracting ore in Mexico, Peru, Chile, Brazil, and Colombia has resumed the primacy it had four hundred years ago, and the business of mining has gone a long way to redefine progress, boost economies, lift people out of poverty, and touch every aspect of the social fabric. Precious minerals pass from rural to urban handlers, from brown hands to white, from poor to rich. The gold that is dug from the rock beneath Leonor&#x2019;s hut fuels an elaborate economy: the seedy beer hall a few steps from her door, the flocks of child prostitutes down-mountain in Putina, the bankers in Lima, geologists in Canada, socialites in Paris, investors in China. It is an industry whose profits ultimately go overseas to Toronto, Denver, London, Shanghai, much as gold once crossed the Atlantic Ocean in Spanish galleons and made its way to Madrid, Amsterdam, and Peking. The general flow of revenue has not changed. It lingers briefly&#x2014;enough for a beer at the cantina or a fly-bitten shank of goat to hang from the roof beam&#x2014;and then it goes out. Away. Over there.<br> <br>The &#x201c;sword,&#x201d; too, has weathered history, from the keenly honed slate blades that Chim� warriors used to disembowel their enemies, to the crude kitchen knives deployed by Zeta gangsters in the Mexican city of Ju�rez. A culture of violence persists in Latin America, lurking in shadows, waiting to erupt, threatening the region&#x2019;s fitful progress toward peace and prosperity. The sword has been the ever-ready instrument in this precinct of stark inequalities: as useful in Augusto Pinochet&#x2019;s 1970s Chile, among a largely white, literate population, as in today&#x2019;s blood-soaked streets of Honduras among the illiterate poor. The ten most dangerous cities in the world are all in Latin American countries. Little wonder that the United States has seen a flood of desperate immigrants fleeing Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador. Fear is the engine that drives Latin Americans north.<br> <br>As for &#x201c;stone&#x2019;s&#x201d; purchase on the spirit, there is no question that organized religion has played&#x2014;and continues to play&#x2014;a crucial role in these Americas. From the days of the Inca, when the great rulers Pachacutec Inca Yupanqui and Tupac Inca Yupanqui &#x201c;turned the world&#x201d; and expanded the empire by conquering vast swaths of South America and forcing the vanquished masses to worship the sun, faith has been a weapon of coercion as well as an instrument for social cohesion. The Aztecs shared the Incas&#x2019; appetite for conquest as well as a keen appreciation for the uses of religion. But they had a starkly different approach to conversion: they often adopted the deities of the newly conquered with the understanding that someone else&#x2019;s god might have much in common with one&#x2019;s own. Stroll through any Mesoamerican or Andean village, and you will find lively expressions of those ancient beliefs in contemporary art and ritual traditions.<br> <br>Today, although various Amerindian, African, Asian, and European faiths are practiced in Latin America, the region remains firmly stamped with the one Spain imposed on it more than five hundred years ago. It is adamantly Catholic. A full 40 percent of all the world&#x2019;s Catholics reside here, and, as a result, a strong bond unites the believers, from Montevideo, Uruguay, to Monterrey, Mexico. Indeed Sim�n Bol�var, who liberated six South American republics, imagined the Spanish-speaking, Catholic nations of those Americas as a potentially powerful unified force in the greater world. The Spanish Crown may have worked mightily to keep its colonies from communicating, trading, or establishing human concord, but it joined them forever when it led them to the feet of Jesus. In the end, Bol�var was never able to fashion a strong Pan-American union from the diverse, restless population of Spanish-speaking Christians that he liberated. But the Church today remains, as it was in Bol�var&#x2019;s time, the most trusted institution in all of Latin America.<br> <br>This is a book about three components of Latin American society that have shaped it for a thousand years. It does not pretend to be a definitive, comprehensive history. Rather, it is meant to cast light on the legacy of the Latin American people and on three elements of our past that may suggest something about our future. Certainly there are other obsessions we share that make for a brighter portrait of the region: our infatuation with art, for instance; our enthusiasm for music, our culinary passions, our love of rhetoric. The Spanish language that flows from the pens of Latin Americans has produced one of the most strikingly original literatures of our time. There are also few regional traits that shine more brightly than our fidelity to family or our propensity for human warmth. But none of these, in my view, has moved populations, marked the landscape, and written history as forcefully as Latin America&#x2019;s fixations on mining, or its romance with brute force, or religion.<br> <br>These obsessions are not tidy strands that can be addressed as independent narratives. Their histories over the course of the past one thousand years have clashed, overlapped, become intricately intertwined, just as gold, faith, and fear are tightly woven skeins in the life of Leonor Gonz�les. But Latin America&#x2019;s inclinations to religion and violence, along with its stubborn adherence to an ancient form of extractive commerce that doesn&#x2019;t necessarily lead to lasting development, have fascinated me for years. I believe the history of these inclinations can tell us much about who we Latin Americans are. And we are, as a historian once said, &#x201c;a continent made to undermine conventional truths,&#x201d; a region unto ourselves, unlike any other, where theories or doctrines fashioned elsewhere seldom have purchase. I also believe that, for all the years I have spent following the ways and warps of this skeined history, it cannot possibly tell the whole story.<br> <br>How do you explain a hemisphere and its people? It&#x2019;s an impossible task, really, made more complicated by five hundred years of skewed historical record. All the same, I am convinced that there is a commonality&#x2014;a concrete character, if you will&#x2014;that emerges from the Spanish American experience. I am also convinced that this character is a direct product of the momentous confrontation between two worlds. We are defined by a grudging tolerance born of this experience. There is no northern equivalent.<br> <br>In Latin America, we may not always know exactly what breed we represent, but we do know that we are more bound to this &#x201c;New World&#x201d; than we are to the &#x201c;Old.&#x201d; After centuries of unrestrained mixing, we are more brown than white, more black or Indian than some might think. But, since raw political power has been held stubbornly by every anxious generation of &#x201c;whites&#x201d; since First Contact, a true reckoning of our identity has always been a tenuous proposition. Call it what ...</p><h2>Austerity Ecology &amp; the Collapse-Porn Addicts: A Defence Of Growth, Progress, Industry And Stuff</h2><p>Economic growth, progress, industry and, erm, stuff have all come in for a sharp kicking from the green left and beyond in recent years. Everyone from black-hoodied Starbucks window-smashers to farmers&#39; market heirloom-tomato-mongers to Prince Charles himself seem to be embracing &#39;degrowth&#39; and anti-consumerism, which is nothing less than a form of ecological austerity. Meanwhile, the back-to-the-land ideology and aesthetic of locally-woven organic carrot-pants, pathogen-encrusted compost toilets and civilisational collapse is hegemonic. Yet modernity is not the cause of climate change and the wider biocrisis. It is indeed capitalism that is the source of our environmental woes, but capitalism as a mode of production, not the fuzzy understanding of capitalism of Naomi Klein, Bill McKibben, Derrick Jensen, Paul Kingsnorth and their anarcho-liberal epigones as a sort of globalist corporate malfeasance. In combative and puckish style, science journalist Leigh Phillips marshals evidence from climate science, ecology, paleoanthropology, agronomy, microbiology, psychology, history, the philosophy of mathematics, and heterodox economics to argue that progressives must rediscover their historic, Promethean ambitions and counter this reactionary neo-Malthusian ideology that not only retards human flourishing, but won&#39;t save the planet anyway. We want to take over the machine and run it rationally, not turn the machine off.</p><p>Leigh Phillips is a science and EU affairs journalist who has written for Nature, the Guardian, the New Statesman, and Jacobin."In an age of wilting ambition and self-imposed frugality, Leigh Phillips has written an important rallying cry for both the desirability and possibility of a radically better future. Against the austerity of neoliberalism and the austere life of the 'small is beautiful' crowd, Phillips reasserts our capacity to go beyond parochial constraints. This is a work that deserves to be read widely." - Nick Srnicek, co-author of <i>Inventing the Future</i> and the <i>Accelerationist Manifesto</i><br><br>"As erudite as it is justifiably polemical. Leigh Phillips takes no prisoners. The book should be titled "Manifesto for the Green Jacobins", and read in the spirit of <i>The Holy Family, Or a Critique of Critical Criticism</i> about the Bauers. A refreshing antidote to technological pessimism. Cures intellectual drowsiness." -&nbsp;Calestous Juma,&nbsp;Director of the Science, Technology and Globalization Project at the Havard Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs</p><h2>Alabama&#39;s Civil Rights Trail: An Illustrated Guide to the Cradle of Freedom (Alabama: The Forge of History)</h2><p>No other state has embraced and preserved its civil rights history more thoroughly than Alabama. Nor is there a place where that history is richer. <i>Alabama&#x2019;s Civil Rights Trail</i> tells of Alabama&#x2019;s great civil rights events, as well as its lesser-known moments, in a compact and accessible narrative, paired with a practical guide to Alabama&#x2019;s preserved civil rights sites and monuments.&nbsp;&nbsp;In his history of Alabama&#x2019;s civil rights movement, <i>Cradle of Freedom </i>(University of Alabama Press, 2004), Frye Gaillard contends that Alabama played the lead role in a historic movement that made all citizens of the nation, black and white, more free. This book, geared toward the casual traveler and the serious student alike, showcases in a vividly illustrated and compelling manner, valuable and rich details. It provides a user-friendly, graphic tool for the growing number of travelers, students, and civil rights pilgrims who visit the state annually.&nbsp;The story of the civil rights movement in Alabama is told city by city, region by region, and town by town, with entries on Montgomery, Birmingham, Selma, Tuscaloosa, Tuskegee, and Mobile, as well as chapters on the Black Belt and the Alabama hill country. Smaller but important locales such as Greensboro, Monroeville, and Scottsboro are included, as are more obscure sites like Hale County&#x2019;s Safe House Black History Museum and the birthplace of the Black Panther Party in Lowndes County.</p><p><b>Frye Gaillard</b> has been a journalist for the Associated Press and the <i>Charlotte Observer</i>.

The 23 cities included in the guide span the full length of the state, from Florence to Bayou la Batre. In contrast, the state tourism department&#x2019;s civil rights trail guide covers only five cities, Birmingham, Greensboro, Selma, Montgomery and Tuskegee.

He is the author of eight books, including the national bestseller <i>Making Loss Matter: Creating Meaning in Difficult Times</i>.Wolpe, a young rabbi, has tackled the difficult age-old challenges of injustice, the suffering of the innocent, and the prospering of the wicked. Building on such biblical passages as Exodus 34:6-7, which portray the compassionate, merciful nature of God, he projects the image of a God intimately concerned with human beings. Wolpe does a credible job of synthesizing biblical texts, rabbinic sources, Midrashic homilies, and Hassidic tales in this poetic, impressionistic, yet ultimately disconnected exposition. His writing is imbued with mystical overtones containing faint echoes from the works of the late revered Abraham Heschel. He breaks no new ground using the prism of God as healer, but this depiction can bring some comfort to those who struggle with theological problems.<br><i>- Carol R.

Under the dhimmi religious caste system, non-Muslims were subjected to legal and financial oppression, as well as social isolation. Extensive primary and secondary source materials, many translated here for the first time into English, are presented, making clear that jihad conquests were brutal, imperialist advances, which spurred waves of Muslims to expropriate a vast expanse of lands and subdue millions of indigenous peoples. Finally, the book examines how jihad war, as a permanent and uniquely Islamic institution, ultimately regulates the relations of Muslims with non-Muslims to this day.

In seven provocative essays, Zipes discusses the importance of investigating oral folk tales in their socio-political context and traces their evolution into literary fairy tales, a metamorphosis that often diminished the ideology of the original narrative. Zipes also looks at how folk tales influence our popular beliefs and the ways they have been exploited by a corporate media network intent on regulating the mystical elements of the stories. He examines a range of authors, including the Brothers Grimm, Hans Christian Anderson, Ernst Bloch, Tolkien, Bettelheim, and J.K.

He also writes the Codex Alera series. Butcher lives in Missouri with his wife, son, and a ferocious guard dog.<br>Most of my cases are pretty tame. Someone loses a piece of jewelry with a lot of sentimental value, or someone comes to me because they&#x2019;ve just moved into a new house and it&#x2019;s a little more haunted than the seller&#x2019;s disclosure indicated. Nothing Chicago&#x2019;s only professional wizard can&#x2019;t handle&#x2014;but the cases don&#x2019;t usually rake in much money, either.<br>So when a man in a two-thousand-dollar suit opened my office door and came inside, he had my complete attention.<br>I mean, I didn&#x2019;t take my feet down off my desk or anything. But I paid attention.<br>He looked my office up and down and frowned, as though he didn&#x2019;t much approve of what he saw. Then he looked at me and said, &#x201c;Excuse me, is this the office of&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Dolce,&#x201d; I said.<br>He blinked. &#x201c;Excuse me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Your suit,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Dolce and Gabbana. Silk. Very nice. You might want to consider an overcoat, though, now that it&#x2019;s cooling off. Paper says we&#x2019;re in for some rain.&#x201d;<br>He studied me intently for a moment. He was a man in his late prime. His hair was dyed too dark, and the suit looked like it probably hid a few pounds. &#x201c;You must be Harry Dresden.&#x201d;<br>I inclined my head toward him. &#x201c;Agent or attorney?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;A little of both,&#x201d; he said, looking around my office again. &#x201c;I represent a professional entertainment corporation, which wishes to remain anonymous for the time being. My name is Donovan. My sources tell me that you&#x2019;re the man who might be able to help us.&#x201d;<br>My office isn&#x2019;t anything to write home about. It&#x2019;s on a corner, with windows on two walls, but it&#x2019;s furnished for function, not style&#x2014;scuffed-up wooden desks, a couple of comfortable chairs, some old metal filing cabinets, a used wooden table, and a coffeepot that is old enough to have belonged to Neanderthals. I figured Donovan was worried that he&#x2019;d exposed his suit to unsavory elements, and resisted an irrational impulse to spill my half cup of cooling coffee on it.<br>&#x201c;That depends.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;On what?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What you need and whether you can afford me.&#x201d;<br>Donovan fixed me with a stern look. I bore up under it as best I could. &#x201c;Do you intend to gouge me for a fee, Mr. Dresden?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;For every penny I reasonably can,&#x201d; I told him.<br>He blinked at me. &#x201c;You&nbsp;... you&#x2019;re quite up front about it, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Saves time,&#x201d; I said.<br>&#x201c;What makes you think I would tolerate such a thing?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;People don&#x2019;t come to me until they&#x2019;re pretty desperate, Mr. Donovan,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;especially rich people and hardly ever corporations. Besides, you come in here all intriguey and coy, not wanting to reveal who your employer is. That means that in addition to whatever else you want from me, you want my discretion, too.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So your increased fee is a polite form of blackmail?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Cost of doing business. If you want this done on the down low, you make my job more difficult. You should expect to pay a little more than a conventional customer when you&#x2019;re asking for more than they are.&#x201d;<br>He narrowed his eyes at me. &#x201c;How much are you going to cost me?&#x201d;<br>I shrugged a shoulder. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s find out. What do you want me to do?&#x201d;<br>He stood up and turned to walk to the door. He stopped before he reached it, read the words HARRY DRESDEN, WIZARD backward in the frosted glass, and eyed me over his shoulder. &#x201c;I assume that you have heard of any number of curses in local folklore.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I said.<br>&#x201c;I suppose you&#x2019;ll expect me to believe in their existence.&#x201d;<br>I shrugged. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll exist or not exist regardless of what you believe, Mr. Donovan.&#x201d; I paused. &#x201c;Well. Apart from the ones that&nbsp;<i>don&#x2019;t</i>&nbsp;exist except in someone&#x2019;s mind. They&#x2019;re only real&nbsp;<i>because</i>&nbsp;somebody believes. But that edges from the paranormal over toward psychology. I&#x2019;m not licensed for that.&#x201d;<br>He grimaced and nodded. &#x201c;In that case...&#x201d;<br>I felt a little slow off the mark as I realized what we were talking about. &#x201c;A cursed local entertainment corporation,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Like maybe a sports team.&#x201d;<br>He kept a poker face on, and it was a pretty good one.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re talking about the Billy Goat Curse,&#x201d; I said.<br>Donovan arched an eyebrow and then gave me an almost imperceptible nod as he turned around to face me again. &#x201c;What do you know about it?&#x201d;<br>I blew out my breath and ran my fingers back through my hair. &#x201c;Uh, back in 1945 or so, a tavern owner named Sianis was asked to leave a World Series game at Wrigley. Seems his pet goat was getting rained on and it smelled bad. Some of the fans were complaining. Outraged at their lack of social �lan, Sianis pronounced a curse on the stadium, stating that never again would a World Series game be played there. Well, actually he said something like, &#x2018;Them Cubs, they ain&#x2019;t gonna win no more,&#x2019; but the World Series thing is the general interpretation.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And?&#x201d; Donovan asked.<br>&#x201c;And I think if I&#x2019;d gotten kicked out of a Series game I&#x2019;d been looking forward to, I might do the same thing.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You have a goat?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I have a moose,&#x201d; I said.<br>He blinked at that for a second, didn&#x2019;t understand it, and decided to ignore it. &#x201c;If you know that, then you know that many people believe that the curse has held.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Where the Series is concerned, the Cubbies have been filled with fail and dipped in suck sauce since 1945,&#x201d; I acknowledged. &#x201c;No matter how hard they try, just when things are looking up, something seems to go bad at the worst possible time.&#x201d; I paused to consider. &#x201c;I can relate.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a fan, then?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;More of a kindred spirit.&#x201d;<br>He looked around my office again and gave me a small smile. &#x201c;But you follow the team.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I go to games when I can.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That being the case,&#x201d; Donovan said, &#x201c;you know that the team has been playing well this year.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And the Cubs want to hire yours truly to prevent the curse from screwing things up.&#x201d;<br>Donovan shook his head. &#x201c;I never said that the Cubs organization was involved.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Hell of a story, though, if they were.&#x201d;<br>Donovan frowned severely.<br>&#x201c;The&nbsp;<i>Sun-Times</i>&nbsp;would run it on the front page. CUBS HIRE PROFESSIONAL WIZARD TO BREAK CURSE, maybe. Rick Morrissey would have a ball with that story.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;My clients,&#x201d; Donovan said firmly, &#x201c;have authorized me to commission your services on this matter, if it can be done quickly&#x2014;and with the utmost discretion.&#x201d;<br>I swung my feet down from my desk. &#x201c;Mr. Donovan,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;No one does discretion like me.&#x201d;<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Two hours after I had begun my calculations, I dropped my pencil on the laboratory table and stretched my back. &#x201c;Well. You&#x2019;re right.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course I&#x2019;m right,&#x201d; said Bob the Skull. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m always right.&#x201d;<br>I gave the dried, bleached human skull sitting on a shelf amidst a stack of paperback romance novels a gimlet-eye.<br>&#x201c;For&nbsp;<i>some</i>&nbsp;values of right,&#x201d; he amended hastily. The words were conciliatory, but the flickering flames in the skull&#x2019;s eye sockets danced merrily.<br>My laboratory is in the subbasement under my basement apartment. It&#x2019;s dark, cool, and dank, essentially a concrete box that I have to enter by means of a folding staircase. It isn&#x2019;t a big room, but it&#x2019;s packed with the furnishings of one. Lots of shelves groan under the weight of books, scrolls, papers, alchemical tools, and containers filled with all manner of magical whatnot.<br>There&#x2019;s a silver summoning circle on the floor, and a tiny-scale model of the city of Chicago on a long table running down the middle of the room. The only shelf not crammed full is Bob&#x2019;s, and even it gets a little crowded sometimes. Bob is my more-or-less-faithful, not-so-trusty assistant, a spirit of intellect that dwells within a specially enchanted skull. I might be a wizard, but Bob&#x2019;s knowledge of magic makes me look like an engineering professor.<br>&#x201c;Are you sure there&#x2019;s nothing you missed?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&#x201c;Nothing&#x2019;s certain, boss,&#x201d; the skull said philosophically. &#x201c;But you did the equations. You know the power requirements for a spell to continue running through all those sunrises.&#x201d;<br>I grunted sourly. The cycles of time in the world degrade ongoing magic, and your average enchantment doesn&#x2019;t last for more than a few days. For a curse to be up and running since 1945, it would have had to begin as a malevolent enchantment powerful enough to rip a hole through the crust of the planet. Given the lack of lava in the area, it would seem that whatever the Billy Goat Curse might be, I could be confident that it wasn&#x2019;t a simple magical working.<br>&#x201c;Nothing&#x2019;s ever simple,&#x201d; I complained.<br>&#x201c;What did you expect, boss?&#x201d; Bob said.<br>I growled. &#x201c;So the single-spell theory is out.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yep,&#x201d; Bob said.<br>&#x201c;Which means that either the curse is being powered by something that renews its energy&#x2014;or else someone is refreshing the thing all the time.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What about this Sianis guy&#x2019;s family?&#x201d; Bob said. &#x201c;Maybe they&#x2019;re putting out a fresh whammy every few days or something.&#x201d;<br>I shook my head. &#x201c;I called records in Edinburgh. The wardens checked them out years ago when all of this first happened, and they aren&#x2019;t practitioners. Besides, they&#x2019;re Cub-friendly.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The wardens investigated the Greek guy but not the curse?&#x201d; Bob asked curiously.<br>&#x201c;In 1945 the White Council had enough to do trying to mitigate the bad mojo from all those artifacts the Nazis stockpiled,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Once they established that no one&#x2019;s life was in danger, they didn&#x2019;t really care if a bunch of guys playing a game got cursed to lose it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So what&#x2019;s your next move?&#x201d;<br>I tapped my chin thoughtfully with one finger. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go look at the stadium.&#x201d;<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>I put Bob in the mesh sack I sometimes tote him around in and, at his petulant insistence, hung it from the rearview mirror of my car, a battered old Volkswagen Beetle. He hung there, swinging back and forth and occasionally spinning one way or the other when something caught his eye.<br>&#x201c;Look at the legs on that one!&#x201d; Bob said. &#x201c;And whew, check&nbsp;<i>her</i>&nbsp;out! It must be chilly tonight!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a reason we don&#x2019;t get out more often, Bob,&#x201d; I sighed. I should have known better than to drive through the club district on my way to Wrigley.<br>&#x201c;I love the girls&#x2019; pants in this century,&#x201d; Bob said. &#x201c;I mean&nbsp;<i>look</i>&nbsp;at those jeans. One little tug and off they come.&#x201d;<br>I wasn&#x2019;t touching that one.<br>I parked the car a couple of blocks from the stadium, stuck Bob in a pocket of my black leather duster, and walked in. The Cubs were on the road, and Wrigley was closed. It was a good time to knock around inside. But since Donovan was evidently prepared to deny and disavow all knowledge, I wasn&#x2019;t going to be able to simply knock on the door and wander in.<br>So I picked a couple of locks at a delivery entrance and went inside. I didn&#x2019;t hit it at professional-burglar speed or anything&#x2014;I knew a couple of guys who could open a lock with tools as fast as they could with a key&#x2014;but I wasn&#x2019;t in any danger of getting a ticket for loitering, either. Once I was inside, I headed straight for the concourses. If I mucked around in the stadium&#x2019;s administrative areas, I would probably run afoul of a full-blown security system, and the only thing I could reliably do to that would be to shut it down completely&#x2014;and most systems are smart enough to tip off their home security company when that happens.<br>Besides. What I was looking for wouldn&#x2019;t be in any office.<br>I took Bob out of my pocket so that the flickering golden-orange lights of his eyes illuminated the area in front of me. &#x201c;All right,&#x201d; I murmured. I kept my voice down, on the off chance that a night watchman might be on duty and nearby. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m angry at the Cubbies and I&#x2019;m pitching my curse at them. Where&#x2019;s it going to stick?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s really no question about that, is there?&#x201d; Bob asked me.<br>&#x201c;Home plate,&#x201d; we said together.<br>I started forward, walking silently. Being quiet when you sneak around isn&#x2019;t difficult, as long as you aren&#x2019;t in any rush. The serious professionals can all but sprint in perfect silence, but the main thing you need isn&#x2019;t agility&#x2014;it&#x2019;s patience and calm. So I moved out slowly and calmly, and it must have worked, because nobody raised a hue or a cry.<br>The empty, unlit stadium was&nbsp;... just wrong. I was used to seeing Wrigley blazing with sunlight or its lights, filled with fans and music and the smell of overpriced, fattening, and inexplicably gratifying food. I was used to vendors shouting, the constant sea-surge of crowd noise, and the buzz of planes passing overhead, trailing banners behind them.<br>Now Wrigley Field was vast and dark and empty. There was something silently sad about it&#x2014;acres of seats with no one sitting, a green and beautiful field that no one was playing on, a scoreboard that didn&#x2019;t have anything on it to read or anyone to read it. If the gods and muses were to come down from Olympus and sculpt unfulfilled potential as a physical form, they wouldn&#x2019;t get any closer than that hollow house did.<br>I walked down the concrete steps and circled the infield until I could make my way to the seats behind home plate. Once there, I held Bob up and said, &#x201c;What have we got?&#x201d;<br>The skull&#x2019;s eyelights flared brighter for a second, and he snorted. &#x201c;Oh, yeah. Definitely tied the curse together right there.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s keeping it going?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Is there a ley line passing underneath or something?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a negative, boss,&#x201d; Bob said.<br>&#x201c;How fresh is it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Maybe a couple of days,&#x201d; the skull replied. &#x201c;Maybe more. It&#x2019;s an awfully tight weave.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How so?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;This spell resists deterioration better than most mortal magic. It&#x2019;s efficient and solid&#x2014;way niftier than you could manage.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Gee. Thanks.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I call &#x2019;em like I see &#x2019;em,&#x201d; Bob said cheerfully. &#x201c;So either a more experienced member of the White Council is sponsoring this curse, and refreshing it every so often, or else...&#x201d;<br>I caught on. &#x201c;Or else the curse was placed here by a nonmortal being.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Bob said. &#x201c;But that could be almost anything.&#x201d;<br>I shook my head. &#x201c;Not necessarily. Remember that the curse was laid upon the stadium during a game in the 1945 World Series.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ah, yes,&#x201d; Bob said. &#x201c;It would have been packed. Which means that whatever the being was, it could blend in. Either a really great veil or maybe a shapeshifter.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; I repeated. &#x201c;Why would this theoretical being have put out the curse on the Cubs?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Plenty of beings from the Nevernever really don&#x2019;t need a motivation.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sure they do,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;The logic behind what they do might be alien or twisted beyond belief, but it makes sense to them.&#x201d; I waved my hand at the stadium. &#x201c;This being not only laid a curse on a nexus of human emotional power, it kept coming back week after week, year after year.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see what you&#x2019;re driving at, boss.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Whoever&#x2019;s doing this is holding a grudge,&#x201d; I said thoughtfully. &#x201c;This is vengeance for a genuine insult. It&#x2019;s personal.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Maybe,&#x201d; Bob said. &#x201c;But maybe the emotional state of the stadium supercharged Sianis&#x2019;s curse. Or maybe after the stadium evicted Sianis, who didn&#x2019;t have enough power to curse anybody anyhow, someone decided to make it stick.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Or maybe...&#x201d; My voice trailed off, and then I barked out a short bite of laughter. &#x201c;Oh. Oh, that&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>funny&lt;...</i></p><h2>The Long Road Home (A Place Called Home Series #3)</h2><p><p>&nbsp;"She can't be dead!" the young pastor cried as he looked down at the still, white face of his new bride.

Before they made the films which are their principal legacy, the Marx Brothers were the stars of three Broadway musicals in the 1920s. Two of these, The Cocoanuts and Animal Crackers, are popular classics, familiar from the Brothers&#x2019; immortal film versions, and from numerous stage revivals. But the boys&#x2019; 1924 Broadway debut, I&#x2019;ll Say She Is, was never filmed or revived, and it slipped through history&#x2019;s fingers. Although it was the most successful thing the Marx Brothers ever did on stage, it was unseen for ninety years after the original production closed, and has been considered a lost work. In 2009, writer, performer, lyricist, and Groucho Marxist Noah Diamond began a seven-year odyssey which led to the restoration, adaptation, and finally the historic first revival of this legendary entry in the Marx and musical theatre canons. Gimme a Thrill tells the whole story for the first time&#x2014;the complete history of I&#x2019;ll Say She Is from 1923 to 2014. Noah Diamond adapted the book and lyrics for I&#x2019;ll Say She Is and has a long history of playing Groucho, on and off the stage. He is among the organizers of Marxfest, New York City&#x2019;s Marx Brothers festival, and has written and lectured widely on the Marxes and their work. With his partner Amanda Sisk, he wrote and produced the Nero Fiddled musicals, a series of political satires. His previous books are 400 Years in Manhattan and Love Marches On.</p><p></p><h2>Theaster Gates (Phaidon Contemporary Artists Series)</h2><p>Theaster Gates</p><p><p>Theaster Gates is an artist whose practice includes sculpture, installation, performance, architecture and urban interventions designed to bridge the gap between art and life.</p><p>Carol Becker is Dean of Faculty and Professor of the Arts at Columbia University School of the Arts.

Then, in the 1960s and 1970s, American cinema &#x201c;grew up&#x201d; in response to the sexual revolution, and movie audiences came to expect more knowledge about what happened between the sheets. In Screening Sex, the renowned film scholar Linda Williams investigates how sex acts have been represented on screen for more than a century and, just as important, how we have watched and experienced those representations. Whether examining the arch artistry of Last Tango in Paris, the on-screen orgasms of Jane Fonda, or the anal sex of two cowboys in Brokeback Mountain, Williams illuminates the forms of pleasure and vicarious knowledge derived from screening sex.<p></p><p>Combining stories of her own coming of age as a moviegoer with film history, cultural history, and readings of significant films, Williams presents a fascinating history of the on-screen kiss, a look at the shift from adolescent kisses to more grown-up displays of sex, and a comparison of the &#x201c;tasteful&#x201d; Hollywood sexual interlude with sexuality as represented in sexploitation, Blaxploitation, and avant-garde films. She considers Last Tango in Paris and Deep Throat, two 1972 films unapologetically all about sex; In the Realm of the Senses, the only work of 1970s international cinema that combined hard-core sex with erotic art; and the sexual provocations of the mainstream movies Blue Velvet and Brokeback Mountain. She describes art films since the 1990s, in which the sex is aggressive, loveless, or alienated. Finally, Williams reflects on the experience of screening sex on small screens at home rather than on large screens in public. By understanding screening sex as both revelation and concealment, Williams has written the definitive study of sex at the movies.</p><p></p><p>Linda Williams is Professor of Film Studies and Rhetoric at the University of California, Berkeley.

Daring! Shocking! True!" A History of Exploitation Films, 1919-1958 <p>"Linda Williams is a terrific storyteller about sex, and, as she tracks the growth of her own cinematically mediated sexual consciousness, we go to the movies with her, imagining as though for the first time new encounters with explicitness, new sexual knowledge, and new spectatorial sensations."--Lauren Berlant, author of The Female Complaint: The Unfinished Business of Sentimentality in American Culture </p><p>"Screening Sex is a truly remarkable follow-up to Linda Williams's groundbreaking book Hard Core. It reaffirms her place as the leading feminist scholar of the history and theory of on-screen sex. Not that it was ever in doubt."-- Jane Gaines, author of Fire and Desire: Mixed Race Movies in the Silent Era</p></p><h2>Trail Guide To Us Geography Teachers *OP</h2><p>Easy-to-follow resource to teach essential geographical facts and features of each of the 50 U.S. states.

After the Reys escaped Paris by bicycle in 1940 carrying the manuscript for the original&nbsp;<i>Curious George</i>, the book was published in America in 1941. More than 200 Curious George titles followed, with 75 million books sold&nbsp;worldwide. Curious George has been successfully adapted into a major motion picture and an Emmy-winning television show on&nbsp;PBS.<br> &nbsp;</p><br><br>The Reys were born in Hamburg, Germany. <b>Hans Augusto Rey</b> (1898-1977) met his wife-to-be, <b>Margret</b> (1906-1996), at a party in her father&#x2019;s home in Germany; when he first caught a glimpse of her, she was sliding down the banister. In their twenties and thirties they lived in Paris and in Rio de Janeiro, where Hans sold bathtubs in villages along the Amazon River. Eventually Cambridge, Massachusetts, became the Reys&#x2019; home and community. Throughout their lives the Reys created many lively books together, including SPOTTY, PRETZEL, and lift-the-flap books such as HOW DO YOU GET THERE? The manuscript of the first Curious George books was one of the few items the Reys carried with them on their bicycles when they escaped from Paris in 1940. Eventually, they made their way to the United States, and CURIOUS GEORGE was published in 1941. Their incorrigible little monkey has become an American icon, selling millions of books and capturing the hearts of readers everywhere. CURIOUS GEORGE has been published in many languages, including French, German, Japanese, Afrikaans, and Norwegian. Additional Curious George books followed, as well as such other favorites as CECILY G. AND THE NINE MONKEYS and FIND THE CONSTELLATIONS.

I eyed my sore, muddied, blistered feet and wished that my black pumps were ruby red and I could click them together to go back home.</p><p>&#x201c;You ready to move again?&#x201d; Rick asked me.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>No, I thought.</p><p>&#x201c;I can see a structure about twenty yards that way,&#x201d; he told me. &#x201c;I think it might be a hunting lodge or a log cabin. We can make it there and hide out till they&#x2019;ve finished looking for us. It&#x2019;ll also give us some shelter from this rain.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yippee,&#x201d; I said woodenly.</p><p>Rick smiled in sympathy and took my hand. &#x201c;Come on, babe. It&#x2019;s not far.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p>Now, you&#x2019;re probably wondering what mess I&#x2019;d gotten myself into this time&#x2014;right? Let me take all that suspense out right now, and admit that it was a doozy!</p><p>It all began a few weeks prior to our mad dash through the forest, at a time when I was feeling . . . well . . . patriotic.</p><p>Of course, when you have three high-ranking members of the FBI, CIA, and armed forces telling you that your country needs you, it can be a powerfully convincing argument.</p><p>You see, several weeks before, there was a breach in our national security of epic proportions. Something was stolen that was so crucial to our country&#x2019;s safety that it left each and every one of us vulnerable.</p><p>What was it? you ask. Well, if I told you, I&#x2019;d have to kill you.</p><p>Ha, ha, ha! <i>Kidding!</i> I&#x2019;ll divulge all; but let me at least start again at the beginning, which, for me, was on a beautiful late-April day in downtown Austin when I was called to a meeting at the FBI field office, where I was a civilian profiling consultant. That&#x2019;s really just a fancy way of saying that, as a professional psychic, I assisted the FBI by pulling warm clues out of the ether on cases that had long since gone cold.</p><p>At this particular meeting was my sweetheart&#x2014; Assistant Special Agent in Charge Dutch Rivers&#x2014;his boss Brice Harrison, his boss FBI regional director Bill Gaston, and a lieutenant colonel with the air force, along with some steely-looking dude from the CIA.</p><p>During the course of that meeting, it became evident that something of <i>great</i> importance had been stolen off a military base and was then summarily smuggled out of the country. The good news was that the item had been traced to Canada. The bad news was that everyone agreed it would not be there for long.</p><p>Now, naturally our government wanted its property back, and so they&#x2019;d sent two CIA agents into Canada to retrieve it. Those agents&#x2019; true identities were discovered, however, and I understand that their demise was swift and most unpleasant . . . something I&#x2019;d rather not think about, actually.</p><p>Anyway, when it became evident that the task of retrieving the article in question was more formidable than first imagined, Bill Gaston thought of me.</p><p>I debated the idea of becoming a spy for about two whole minutes, something in hindsight I&#x2019;m still sort of regretting, but I&#x2019;d agreed, and Dutch and I had flown to Washington, D.C., the following week.</p><p>We&#x2019;d been met at the airport by a lanky young agent with red hair and lots of freckles. He reminded me of Opie. &#x201c;Agent Rivers and Ms. Cooper?&#x201d; he asked, spotting us immediately from the faces in the crowd surrounding the luggage carousel.</p><p>Dutch extended his hand. &#x201c;Agent Spencer?&#x201d;</p><p>Opie shook Dutch&#x2019;s hand warmly. &#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; he said, offering me a nice smile too. &#x201c;Our car is this way.&#x201d;</p><p>We trailed behind Spencer, toting our luggage to a waiting black sedan. I swear, if the FBI ever wants to blend in right, they&#x2019;ll need to add a few Priuses to the fleet.</p><p>Spencer loaded my bag into the trunk and we were on our way. &#x201c;Are you taking us to headquarters?&#x201d; Dutch inquired.</p><p>Spencer shook his head. &#x201c;No, sir,&#x201d; he told us. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been told to bring you to the CIA central office.&#x201d;</p><p>I gulped. I grew up at the height of the cold war, so I still think of the CIA as an agency staffed with seriously scary people willing to do <i>anything</i> for the cause. But I held my nerves in check&#x2014;I mean, I didn&#x2019;t want to appear all fidgety and nervous on my first day of spy school; how uncool would that be?</p><p>We arrived at the CIA central office and Opie handed us off to a female agent dressed in a smart black pantsuit, a crisp white shirt, and no emotion on her face whatsoever.</p><p>She took us through security before seeing us to a large conference room, where nearly a dozen men and one woman were already seated.</p><p>The woman stood when we entered, and I noticed she was at the head of the oval table. &#x201c;Good morning,&#x201d; she said cordially. &#x201c;Agent Rivers, Ms. Cooper, please come in and join us.&#x201d;</p><p>The agent who&#x2019;d shown us in backed out of the room and closed the door. I felt Dutch&#x2019;s hand rest on my lower back as he guided me to the only two available seats left at the table. My mouth went dry as I took my chair, but when I saw FBI director Gaston sitting across from us and smiling warmly, I breathed a teensy bit easier.</p><p>It struck me then that the table was arranged somewhat by rank. The woman at the head of the table was obviously running the show, and she was flanked by two gentlemen whom I&#x2019;d guessed were in their mid-fifties but seemed full of authority. The authority vein trickled down the table from there.</p><p>I also couldn&#x2019;t help noticing many steely eyes were focused my way. I could also see a little disappointment in a few of their expressions while they assessed me head to toe. Not the first time I&#x2019;d experienced that reaction, and likely not the last.</p><p>&#x201c;Welcome to Washington,&#x201d; the woman at the head of the table said into the silence that followed our sitting down. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Christine Tanner, and I&#x2019;m the CIA director of intelligence here in D.C.&#x201d;</p><p>I smiled and nodded to her, and Dutch did the same. And that was it for pleasantries, because Tanner promptly got down to brass tacks by clicking a button on a handheld remote, which caused the conference room to go dark except for the projection of a slide onto a screen at the other end of the room. &#x201c;Ms. Cooper, as you have cleared our security background checks, we feel it wise to educate you on the nature of the security breach we encountered a few weeks ago.&#x201d;</p><p>I focused on the slide, which showed an aerial view of a large air force base. &#x201c;This is a military outpost in southern Nevada. On the morning of April sixth, during a routine flight test, one of our military drones went missing.&#x201d; I heard a click and a new slide showed the image of an unmanned drone aircraft like I&#x2019;d seen on the news used in air strikes against enemy militant fighters in Iraq and Afghanistan, although this one looked much smaller and sleeker in scale and on its top were mounted a small camera and what looked like a small rifle.</p><p>&#x201c;The pilot claimed that midway through the test flight, the operating system on the drone failed, causing it to stop responding to his commands, and eventually crash somewhere out in the desert.&#x201d;</p><p>So far I was following. The air force lost a little drone. Got it.</p><p>&#x201c;It is not unheard of for the operating systems on these aircraft to fail, especially since this model was a prototype.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s smaller than most of your regular drones, right?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>The colonel nodded. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s also the latest in whisper technology. It&#x2019;s powered electrically from a lithium battery, and the drone is virtually silent, which allows it to get within a hundred feet or so of its target without being seen or heard. Because of its advanced technology, this model would be very expensive to replace, and this particular drone was carrying something of great importance, so an extensive search was immediately conducted to retrieve whatever remained of the drone and its cargo.&#x201d;</p><p>I looked at Dutch; he was focused on Tanner in a way that suggested there might be something more to this missing-drone story. &#x201c;After combing through the area where the drone was believed to have crashed, no evidence of it could be found, which is why the military began to suspect the pilot&#x2019;s story.&#x201d;</p><p>A little way down from me and to the right, the lieutenant colonel who&#x2019;d come with Gaston to recruit me in Austin shifted in his seat uncomfortably. Into the silence that followed Tanner&#x2019;s last statement, he said, &#x201c;I personally requested the pilot come in for a polygraph. But when he failed to show up, we went looking for him. We found him on the floor of his shower, shot through the head at point-blank range.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Suicide?&#x201d; I asked, already knowing the answer.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he told me.</p><p>&#x201c;Any leads on who pulled the trigger?&#x201d; Dutch asked.</p><p>&#x201c;No again,&#x201d; said the military man.</p><p>&#x201c;We hope to get Ms. Cooper&#x2019;s intuitive input on that later,&#x201d; Director Gaston said, with a meaningful look at me.</p><p>I nodded. I&#x2019;d do what I could, especially if this was a case of national security.</p><p>Tanner spoke next. &#x201c;Obviously, we no longer suspect there was an operational issue with the drone. We believe the pilot was coerced or bribed into delivering our drone into enemy hands.&#x201d;</p><p>I furrowed my brow. Why was one missing drone causing so much concern? I mean, when I looked back at the slide, the thing looked one step above a model airplane you could buy at any hobby shop.</p><p>Gaston seemed to read my mind, because he spoke next. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s more than just a missing drone,&#x201d; he told me. &#x201c;Agent Tanner, why don&#x2019;t we allow Professor Steckworth to explain?&#x201d;</p><p>Gaston&#x2019;s eyes had settled on a slight man at the end of the table with salt-and-pepper hair and a nose much too big for his small square face. He cleared his throat when all eyes turned to him, and nodded to Tanner, who clicked her remote, and another slide projected onto the screen. It was a photo of a man young enough to be a college student, and somewhat unremarkable in appearance except for the fact that enveloping him on all sides was the most beautiful cloud of color I&#x2019;d ever seen. &#x201c;Oh, my God!&#x201d; I gasped, already understanding what I was looking at.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you know what you&#x2019;re seeing?&#x201d; Professor Steckworth asked, eyeing me keenly.</p><p>I nodded. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve captured the image of his aura.&#x201d; In my mind&#x2019;s eye when I focused only on the young man in the photo, I too saw a cloud of color, though it wasn&#x2019;t nearly as vivid or complete as what I was seeing on the screen.</p><p>Professor Steckworth smiled. &#x201c;Yes, very good, Ms. Cooper. Your own abilities allow you to see auras, I take it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well . . .&#x201d; I hesitated, not wanting everyone to assume my eyesight was clogged with images of color, color everywhere. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s less that I <i>see</i> them and more that I sense them in my mind&#x2019;s eye. If I close my own eyes and focus, I can imagine, if you will, what someone&#x2019;s aura looks like. And in case you&#x2019;re wondering, Professor, yours is mostly deep blue with some wisps of yellow and olive green.&#x201d;</p><p>Professor Steckworth appeared surprised, and he reached for a folder and pulled out a printout of himself, surrounded by a blue bubble with traces of yellow and some olive green, which he held up for everyone to see.</p><p>I sat back in my chair and grinned at each person who&#x2019;d given me a doubtful look when I&#x2019;d walked in. Oh, yeah . . . I&#x2019;m a badass psychic, people . . . uh-huh.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m quite impressed,&#x201d; he said, and I relished the few knowing glances exchanged around the table before the professor motioned to Agent Tanner, and she clicked forward again . . . and again . . . and again. In every slide was the picture of another person wearing a different set of colors, varying in degrees of intensity and vibrancy. I knew why they were showing me the photos. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve documented that each one is unique to the person,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Like a fingerprint.&#x201d;</p><p>Professor Steckworth spoke again. &#x201c;Indeed.&#x201d; He then seemed to want to talk at length and looked to Tanner, who nodded. &#x201c;You see, twenty years ago I had the most astonishing encounter with a woman who claimed to be a psychic. I was working on my PhD at the time, and her abilities so impressed me that I made her the focus of my thesis.</p><p>&#x201c;This woman was also an artist, and for a mere pittance she would paint your portrait and include your individual aura. Of the hundreds of portraits I viewed from her hand, no two were alike, and that began my quest to see if I could prove that auras really existed.</p><p>&#x201c;What I discovered was that each and every human being emits a certain electromagnetic frequency made up of individual wave patterns that is unique to that person&#x2014;no two frequency patterns are alike, not even with identical twins. I then worked with the psychic to match colors to each wavelength and was able to develop digital photography software that captured the frequencies and translated them into a signature color pattern. I called the system Intuit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Awesome,&#x201d; I whispered, completely fascinated by the photos and the professor&#x2019;s s...</p></p><h2>Nature: Course Notes from the Coll�ge de France</h2><p>Collected here are the written traces of courses on the concept of nature given by Maurice Merleau-Ponty at the Coll�ge de France in the 1950s-notes that provide a window on the thinking of one of the most influential philosophers of the twentieth century. In two courses distilled by a student and in a third composed of Merleau-Ponty's own notes, the ideas that animated the philosopher's lectures and that informed his later publications emerge in an early, fluid form in the process of being elaborated, negotiated, critiqued, and reconsidered.<br><br>Merleau-Ponty's project in these courses is an interrogation of nature, a task at the center of his investigation of perception, truth, and subjectivity. The first course, a survey of the historical elements in our concept of nature, examines first the Cartesian concept of nature and then historical and contemporary responses to Descartes, all with an eye toward developing a vision of nature more consistent with the findings of contemporary science. <br><br>In the second course, Merleau-Ponty takes up the problem of the relation of nature to ontology in general. Here, the key question is how the animal finds itself in its world. Because the human body is ultimately "an animal of movements and perceptions," humanity is intertwined with animality.<br><br>In the third course, "Nature and Logos: The Human Body," Merleau-Ponty assesses his previous findings and examines the emergence of the human body at the intersection of nature and Logos. This course, contemporaneous with the working notes for <i>The Visible and the Invisible<i>, allows us to observe the evolution of that work as well as to revisit the research he had begun in <i>Primacy of Perception</i>.<br><br>In these traces: a new reading of Descartes; a measured appreciation of Schelling; an assessment of recent developments in the sciences (both physical and biological) that leads to the notion of the body as a "system of equivalencies"; and an examination of the phenomenon of life. We have a wealth of material that allows us to reconsider Merleau-Ponty's thinking and to engage his philosophical project anew.<br><br>Before his death in 1961, Maurice Merleau-Ponty was chair in philosophy at the Coll�ge de France.<br><br>Robert Vallier is completing his doctoral work on Merleau-Ponty and Schelling at DePaul University.

In the summer of 1964, Ray Davies led The Kinks to fame with their number one hit "You Really Got Me." Within months, they were challenging The Beatles and The Rolling Stones in the charts, swamped by fans and renowned for the rioting at their gigs. Over the next three decades, Davies wrote a string of classics, including "All Day and All of the Night," "Sunny Afternoon," "Waterloo Sunset," and "Lola," securing his status as one of the handful of people to have redefined pop culture over the last 50 years. But Ray&#x2019;s journey was tumultuous in the extreme, featuring breakdowns, lawsuits, punch-ups and a ban from the U.S. for almost four years. His relationship with his brother Dave, The Kinks&#x2019; lead guitarist, is surely the most ferocious and abusive in music history. Based on countless interviews conducted over several decades, this richly detailed biography presents the most frank and intimate portrait yet of Ray Davies, and promises to be the definitive biography of this most fascinating and complicated life.</p><p><b>Johnny Rogan</b> is the author of more than 20 books, including <i>Byrds: Requiem for the Timeless</i>, <i>Morrissey &amp; Marr</i>, and<i> Van Morrison</i>."As definitive a view of the man as anyone could hope for." &#x2014;<i>Times</i><br><br>"[Rogan is] adept at relating the social history of the 1950s and 1960s to Davies&#x2019;s brooding character and lyric obsessions . . .He uncovers psychological traumas everywhere and is fascinating on the bitchy rivalries between 1960s pop titans. . . .Such tales make this . . . oceanically researched biography go with a swing." &#x2014;<i>Sunday Times</i></p><h2>Questions to All Your Answers: The Journey from Folk Religion to Examined Faith</h2><p><p>Many Christians&#x2019; faith exists as a loose collection of unexamined clich�s and slogans borrowed from songs, devotional books, sermon illustrations, and even the internet. Too often this belief system (if it can be called a &#x201c;system&#x201d;) lacks coherence and intelligibility; it can hardly be expressed, let alone defended, to others. The problem with folk religion is that it too easily withers under the onslaughts of secularism or seemingly reasonable answers provided by cults and new religions. Christianity has a long tradition of intellectual examination of other faiths and its own beliefs. Socrates said that the unexamined life is not worth living; great Christian minds of all the ages have believed the unexamined faith is not worth believing. Reflective Christianity is Christian faith that has subjected itself to the rigorous questioning of Scripture, tradition, reason, and experience. It is mature Christian faith that goes on believing even as it questions what it believes. The goal of this book is not to destroy anyone&#x2019;s faith but to build it up by placing it on a firmer foundation of critical examination. Ten popular Christian clich�s are subjected to critical inquiry and interrogated to discover whether they contain truth or are in error. In most cases the conclusion is&#x2014;both. The aim is not to tear down straw men but to demonstrate a path toward stronger, more mature Christian belief.</p></p><p><p>Roger E. Olson (PhD, Rice University) is professor of theology at George W.

His eight books, including Make Way for Ducklings, One Morning in Maine, Time of Wonder and Burt Dow Deep-Water Man are 20th century icons, winning two Caldecott Medals and two Caldecott Honors for Books. <p>Yet little is known of Bob McCloskey's life. As his younger daughter Jane describes in this moving memoir of Bob and his family, he was a shy, quiet man, reluctant to talk about himself or his work. His art spoke or him. </p><p>He and the family did indeed live on the Maine island that figures so largely in many of his books. But they also lived in New York State, in St. Thomas and among the ex-patriate artistic set in Taxco, Mexico, where his children watched him have a nervous breakdown the affected the rest of his life. </p><p>Robert McCloskey: A Private Life in Words and Pictures has more than fifty examples of McCloskey's art that have rarely been seen outside the family and with nearly fifty more of his beloved drawings and paintings. </p><p>Bob McCloskey really did write and paint what he knew: from his Midwestern childhood to island life in Maine.

In 1741, hungry explorers discovered herds of Steller&#x2019;s sea cow in the Bering Strait, and in less than thirty years, the amiable beast had been harpooned into extinction. It&#x2019;s a classic story, but a key fact is often omitted. Bering Island was the last redoubt of a species that had been decimated by hunting and habitat loss years before the&nbsp;explorers set sail.<br><br> As Callum M. Roberts reveals in <i>The Unnatural History of the S</i>ea, the oceans&#x2019; bounty didn&#x2019;t disappear overnight. While today&#x2019;s fishing industry is ruthlessly efficient, intense exploitation began not in the modern era, or even with the dawn of industrialization, but in the eleventh century in medieval Europe. Roberts explores this long and colorful history of commercial fishing, taking readers around the world and through the centuries to witness the transformation of the seas.<br><br> Drawing on firsthand accounts of early explorers, pirates, merchants, fishers, and travelers, the book recreates the oceans of the past: waters teeming with whales, sea lions, sea otters, turtles, and giant fish. The abundance of marine life described by fifteenth century seafarers is almost unimaginable today, but Roberts both brings it alive and artfully traces its depletion. Collapsing fisheries, he shows, are simply the latest chapter in a long history of unfettered commercialization of the seas.<br><br> The story does not end with an empty ocean. Instead, Roberts describes how we might restore the splendor and prosperity of the seas through smarter management of our resources and some simple restraint. From the coasts of Florida to New Zealand, marine reserves have fostered spectacular recovery of plants and animals to levels not seen in a century. They prove that history need not repeat itself: we can leave the oceans richer than we found them.</p><p><p>Callum M. Roberts is professor of marine conservation at the University of York in England. He is a prolific author and researcher, and has advised the U.S., British, and Caribbean governments on the creation of marine reserves. </p><p></p><p></p>"His impressive book, replete with quotations from the reports of early explorers, merchants and travelers describing seas teeming with life that's unimaginable today, is a vivid reminder of what we've lost and a plea to save what is left and help the sea recover some of its earlier bounty." (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>"[Callum] Roberts's book is invaluable, not to mention deeply disturbing." (Jonathan Yardley's 10 best books of the year, "The Washington Post Book World")<br><br>"Passionate and immensely important book . . . ." (<i>The Washington Post</i>)<br><br>"Thank you, Callum Roberts, for your riveting, eloquent, compelling and urgently important saga of what may be the greatest environmental tragedy of our time: the relentless, wholesale extraction of ocean wildlife globally. Thank you, too, for inspiring hope that we still have a chance to reverse the disastrous decline of the ocean, and thus secure our own future, as well as that of fish, whales and clams." (Sylvia Earle <i>Explorer in Residence, National Geographic Society</i>)<br><br>"Well-documented and objective study of the history of fishing and overfishing since the 11th century...." (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>"So fascinating, so well-written, so rich with detail.... I couldn't put this book down." (<i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>)<br><br>"Out of sight, out of mind&#x2014;the wholesale destruction of marine life under the waves by an increasingly rapacious fishing industry has largely gone unnoticed. This eloquent and inspiring book not only reveals the true extent of this loss but also tells of the oceans' amazing powers of regeneration. A long-time advocate for setting aside large areas of ocean as marine reserves and allowing nature to do her own thing, Professor Roberts makes the case crystal clear as to why politicians and society as a whole must act now if we are to save our oceans and the beauty and the bounty they contain." (Richard Page <i>Greenpeace</i>)<br><br>"The accounts presented in <i>The Unnatural History of the Sea</i> provide compelling comparison benchmarks and expose the harm done by mankind's continued view of wildlife solely as commodity." (<i>Honolulu Advertiser</i>)<br><br>"<i>The Unnatural History of the Sea</i> is not just another lament over bygone environmental conditions. Roberts highlights the value of conservation efforts, such as marine reserves (areas off-limits to fishing), reminding readers that an awareness of history is essential to designing such programs." (<i>Audubon</i>)<br><br>"Roberts is eloquent and persuasive as he recounts centuries of ill-managed fishery planning, and allows those who have directly experienced dramatic changes in the oceans to speak for themselves....Thoughtful, inspiring, devastating, and powerful, Roberts' comprehensive, welcoming, and compelling approach to an urgent subject conveys large problems in a succinct and involving manner.

Orosius's History, which begins with the creation and continues to his own day, was an immensely popular and standard work of reference on antiquity throughout the Middle Ages and beyond. Its importance lay in the fact that Orosius was the first Christian author to write not a church history, but rather a history of the secular world interpreted from a Christian perspective. This approach gave new relevance to Roman history in the medieval period and allowed Rome's past to become a valued part of the medieval intellectual world. <br><br>The structure of history and methodology deployed by Orosius formed the dominant template for the writing of history in the medieval period, being followed, for example, by such writers as Otto of Freising and Ranulph Higden. Orosius's work is therefore crucial for an understanding of early Christian approaches to history, the development of universal history, and the intellectual life of the Middle Ages, for which it was both an important reference work and also a defining model for the writing of history.<br></p><p><br><strong>Dr Andrew Fear</strong> is Lecturer in Classics at the University of Manchester.<br><br>"... this new edition does an excellent job in introducing the world of Orosius to those who are inclined to read him. Through the introduction Fear is able to illustrate the importance of the text and the unique contribution it makes to an understanding of early Christian historiography, without overstating the case. A fresh perspective is brought to the text and much deserved attention is directed to Orosius and the early fifth century ..."-<em>Journal of Late Antique Religion and Culture</em> <br><p></p><br>"... as a translation it achieves its aims: this fine rendering of Orosius, especially in combination with the notes, will provide a very useful, new access to the Seven books of History against the Pagans, and thus allow future readers to discover this historian for themselves."--<em>Bryn Mawr</em> <em>Classical Review</em><p></p><br>"Andrew Fear's is the first translation into English of the complete work since 1936, and presents Orosius' sometimes convoluted Latin in very readable English, making this crucial work easily accessible to students and scholars lacking Latin; the extensive annotation will be valuable also for those capable of reading the original."--<em>Medium Aevum</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Half-Made World (The Half-Made World, 1)</h2><p><p>The world is still only half-made.

But locked in his memories is a secret that could change the West forever, and the world's warring powers would do anything to take it from him. </p><p>Now Liv Alverhuysen, a doctor of the new science of psychology, travels west, hoping to heal the general's shattered mind.

There are no faculties of learning in the West, none at all. None worth the name, anyway. Can they even read? You won&#x2019;t have access to any of the journals.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Liv said. &#x201c;I believe they can read.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Seidel overstates his argument,&#x201d; Dr. Naumann said. &#x201c;Seidel is known for overstating his arguments. Eh, Seidel? But not always wrong. You will lose touch with science. You will rip yourself from the bosom of the scientific community.&#x201d;<br>He laughed to show what he thought of the scientific community. Handsome and dark of complexion, Dr. Naumann was the youngest of the Faculty&#x2019;s professors and liked to think of himself as something of a radical. He was engaged in a study of the abnormal or misdirected sexual drive, which he regarded as fundamental to all human activity and belief.<br>Liv smiled politely. &#x201c;I hope you&#x2019;ll write to me, gentlemen. There are mail coaches across the mountains, and the Line will carry mail across the West.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Hah!&#x201d; Dr. Naumann rolled his eyes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen the maps. You&#x2019;re going to the edge of the world, Dr. Alverhuysen. Might as well hope to send mail to the moon, or the bottom of the sea. Are there mail coaches to the moon?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re at war out there,&#x201d; Dr. Seidel said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s very dangerous.&#x201d; He twisted his glass nervously in his hands.<br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Liv agreed. &#x201c;So I&#x2019;ve heard.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There are wild men in the hills, who are from what I hear only very debatably human. I saw a sketch of one once, and I don&#x2019;t mind admitting it gave me nightmares. All hair and knuckles, it was, white as death, and painted in the most awful way.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t be going into the hills, Doctor.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The so-called civilized folk are only marginally better. Quite mad. I don&#x2019;t make that diagnosis lightly. Four centuries of war is hardly the only evidence of it. Consider the principal factions in that war, which are from what I hear not so much political entities as religious enthusiasms, not so much religion as forms of shared mania. . . . Cathexis, that is, a psychotic transference of responsibility from themselves to objects that&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Perhaps you should publish on the subject.&#x201d;<br>If she listened to another moment of Dr. Seidel&#x2019;s shrill voice, she was in danger of having her resolve shaken.<br>&#x201c;Will you excuse me, Doctors?&#x201d; She darted quickly away, neatly interposing Dr. Mistler between herself and Seidel.<br>It was stuffy and dusty in the library; she moved closer to the windows, where there was a breeze and the faint green smell of the gardens, and where Liv&#x2019;s dear friend Agatha from the Faculty of Mathematics was making conversation with Dr. Dahlstrom from the Faculty of Metaphysics, who was terribly dull. As she approached, Agatha waved over Dahlstrom&#x2019;s shoulder and her eyes said, Help! Liv hurried over, sidestepping Dr. Ley, but she was intercepted by Dr. Ekstein, the head of her own Faculty, who was like a looming stone castle topped with a wild beard, and who took both her hands in his powerful ink-stained hands and said: &#x201c;Dr. Alverhuysen&#x2014;may I abandon formality&#x2014;Liv&#x2014;will you be safe? Will you be safe out there? Your poor late husband, rest his soul, would never forgive me if I allowed . . .&#x201d;<br>Dr. Ekstein was a little sherry-drunk and his eyes were moist. His life&#x2019;s work had been a system of psychology that divided the mind into contending forces of thesis and antithesis, from the struggle of which a peaceful synthesis was derived, the process beginning again and again incessantly. Liv considered the theory mechanical and unrealistic.<br>&#x201c;I have made my decision, Doctor,&#x201d; she reminded him. &#x201c;I shall be quite safe. The House Dolorous is in neutral territory, far from the fighting.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Poor Bernhardt,&#x201d; Dr. Ekstein said. &#x201c;He would haunt me if anything were to happen to you&#x2014;not, of course, that I would expect that it would, but if anything were to happen&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>Dr. Naumann insinuated himself. &#x201c;Hauntings? Here? Sounds like you&#x2019;ll miss all the real excitement, Dr. Alverhuysen.&#x201d;<br>Ekstein frowned down on Naumann, who kept talking: &#x201c;On the other hand, you won&#x2019;t be bored&#x2014;oh my no. No place out there is neutral for long. No matter how remote your new employer may be, soon enough you-know-what will come knocking.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid I don&#x2019;t know, Dr. Naumann. I understand things are very turbulent out there. Excuse me, I must&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Turbulent! A good word. If you cut into the living brain of a murderer or sex criminal, you might say what you saw was turbulent. I mean the forces of the Line.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; She tried to look discreetly around Dr. Ekstein&#x2019;s mass for sight of Agatha. &#x201c;Well, isn&#x2019;t that for the best? Isn&#x2019;t the Line on the side of science and order?&#x201d;<br>Dr. Naumann raised an eyebrow, which Liv found irritating. &#x201c;Is that right? Consider Logtown, which they burned to the ground because it harbored Agents of the Gun; consider the conquest of Mason, where . . .&#x201d; He rattled off a long list of battles and massacres.<br>Dr. Alverhuysen looked at him in surprise. &#x201c;You know a lot about the subject.&#x201d;<br>He shrugged. &#x201c;I take an interest in their affairs. A professional interest, you might say.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid I don&#x2019;t follow their politics closely, Dr. Naumann.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You will. You will.&#x201d; He leaned in close and whispered to her, &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll follow you, Liv.&#x201d;<br>She whispered back, &#x201c;Perhaps you should travel that way yourself, Philip.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Absolutely under no circumstances whatsoever.&#x201d; He straightened again and consulted his watch. &#x201c;I shall be late for my afternoon Session!&#x201d; He left his glass on a bookshelf and exited by the south stairs.<br>&#x201c;Unhealthy,&#x201d; Ekstein said. &#x201c;Unhealthy interests.&#x201d; He glanced down at Liv. &#x201c;Unhealthy.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Excuse me, Dr. Ekstein.&#x201d;<br>She stepped around him, exchanged a polite good luck, good luck to you, too, with a gray-haired woman whose name she forgot, passed through a cool breeze and shaft of dusty afternoon sunlight that entered through the oriel window, heard and for nearly the last time was delighted by the sound of the peacocks crying out on the lawns, and deftly linked arms with Agatha and rescued her from Professor Dahlstrom&#x2019;s droning. Unfortunately, Agatha turned out to be a little too drunk and a little too maudlin, and did not share any of Liv&#x2019;s nervous excitement. She blinked back tears and held Liv&#x2019;s hand very tightly and damply and said, &#x201c;Liv&#x2014;oh, Liv. You must promise you&#x2019;ll come back.&#x201d;<br>Liv waved a hand vaguely. &#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m sure I will, Agatha.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You must come back soon.&#x201d;<br>In fact, she hadn&#x2019;t given a moment&#x2019;s thought to when she might return, and the demand rather annoyed her. She said, &#x201c;I shall write, of course.&#x201d;<br>To Liv&#x2019;s relief then, Dr. Ekstein tapped on a glass for silence, and quickly got it, because everyone was by now quite keen to return to their interrupted afternoon&#x2019;s work. He gave a short speech, which did not once mention where Liv was going or why, and rather made it sound as if she were retiring due to advanced senility, which was the Faculty&#x2019;s usual procedure. Finally he presented her with a gift from the Faculty: a golden pocket watch, heavy and overly ornate, etched with sentimental scenes of Koenigswald&#x2019;s mountains and pine forests and gardens and narrow high-peaked houses. The occasion was complete, and the guests dispersed by various doors and into the stacks of the library.The Academy stood on a bend in the river a few miles north of the little town of Lodenstein, which was one of the prettiest and wealthiest towns of Koenigswald, which was itself one of the oldest and wealthiest and most stable and peaceful nations of the old and wealthy and stable and peaceful nations of the old East.<br>Six months ago, a letter had arrived at the Academy from out of the farthest West. It was battered and worn, and stained with red dust, sweat, and oil. It had been addressed to The Academy&#x2014;Koenigswald&#x2014;Of the Seven. Koenigswald&#x2019;s efficient postal service had directed it to Lodenstein without too much difficulty. &#x201c;Of the Seven&#x201d; was a strange affectation, initially confusing, until Dr. Nau-mann remembered that four hundred years ago, Koenigswald had&#x2014;in an uncharacteristic fit of adventurism&#x2014;been one of the Council of Seven Nations that had jointly sent the first expeditions West, over the World&#x2019;s End Mountains, into what was then un-made territory. Perhaps that fact still meant something to the westerners; Koenigswald had largely forgotten it.<br>Strictly speaking, the letter was addressed not to Liv, but to a Mr. Dr. Bernhardt Alverhuysen, which was the name of her late husband, who was recently deceas...</p><h2>Dragon Age: The Stolen Throne</h2><p><p>The thrilling prequel to <i>Dragon Age: Origins</i>, the hit role-playing video game from award-winning developer BioWare!</p><p><b><i>Dragon Age: The Stolen Throne</i></b></p><p>After his mother, the beloved Rebel Queen, is betrayed and murdered by her own faithless lords, young Maric becomes the leader of a rebel army attempting to free his nation from the control of a foreign tyrant.</p><p>His countrymen live in fear; his commanders consider him untested; and his only allies are Loghain, a brash young outlaw who saved his life, and Rowan, the beautiful warrior maiden promised to him since birth.

The hands attempted to haul him back into the clearing, and he dug his boots into the ground, gaining a bit of purchase on gnarled tree roots. Maric violently shoved back again, his elbow connecting with something hard .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. something that gave way with a wet crunching sound and a startled grunt of pain.</p><p>The hands loosened, and Maric leaped forward into the trees. His cloak resisted, jerked him back. Something had caught on his long leather coat. He twisted and fought frantically, like a wild beast caught in a trap, until he somehow wriggled himself out, leaving the cloak torn on a branch. Maric gasped, launching himself into the darkness beyond the clearing without risking even a glance behind. The forest was old and thick, allowing only the faintest beams of moonlight through the dense canopy. It was not enough to see by, only enough to turn the forest into a maze of frightening shadows and silhouettes. Tall twisted oaks stood like dark sentinels, surrounded by dense bushes and recesses so black, they could have held almost anything.</p><p>He had no idea where he was going; only his urge to flee guided his feet. He stumbled over roots that jutted out of the uneven ground and bounced off solid tree trunks that kept springing out of nowhere. Wet and slippery mud made his steps treacherous and his balance so precarious, it seemed the ground might give way beneath him at any moment. The woods were completely disorienting. He could have been running in circles, for all he knew. Maric heard men shouting as they entered the woods behind him, giving chase, and he could clearly make out the sounds of fighting as well. Steel blade ringing on steel blade, the cries of men dying--his mother's men, many he had known his entire life.</p><p>As he frantically ran on, images kept whirling through Maric's mind. Moments ago, he had been shivering in the cold forest clearing, convinced that his presence at the clandestine meeting was more a formality than anything else. He barely paid attention to the proceedings. His mother had informed him earlier that with the support of these new men, the rebellion would finally become a force. These men were willing to turn on their Orlesian masters, she said, and that made it an opportunity she wasn't willing to pass up after so many years spent running and hiding and only picking what battles they could win. Maric hadn't objected to the meeting, and the idea that it might be risky never even occurred to him. His mother was the infamous Rebel Queen; it was she who had first inspired the rebellion, and she who led the army. The battle had always been hers and never his. He, himself, had never even seen his grandfather's throne, never understood the power his family had possessed before the Orlesians invaded. He had spent his entire eighteen years in rebel camps and remote castles, endlessly marching and forever being dragged along in his mother's wake. He couldn't even imagine what it might be like to not live that way; it was a completely foreign concept to him.</p><p>And now his mother was dead. Maric's balance was ripped from him, and he tumbled in darkness down a short hill covered in wet leaves. He slid awkwardly and slammed his head against a rock, crying out in pain. His vision swam.</p><p>From far off came a muffled answering cry of his pursuers. They had heard him.</p><p>Maric lay there in the moonlit shadows, cradling his head. It felt like it was on fire, a raging inferno that blotted out reason. He cursed himself for being so stupid. By sheer luck if nothing else, he had managed to run some distance into the forest, and now he had given away his location. There was a thick wetness on his fingers. Blood was caking in his hair and running down around his ears and neck--warm in sharp contrast with the frosty air.</p><p>For a moment he shook, a single sob escaping his lips. Maybe it was best just to lie here, he thought. Let them come and kill him, too. They had already killed his mother and earned whatever lavish reward the usurper had surely promised them. What was he, besides an extra body to be slaughtered along with the too-few men Mother had brought? And then he froze as a terrible realization settled at the edge of his consciousness.</p><p>He was the King.</p><p>It was ridiculous, of course. Him? The one who elicited so many impatient sighs and worried looks? The one for whom Mother always had to make excuses? She had always assured him that once he got older, he would grow into the same easy authority that she evinced. But that had never happened. It was no great offense, either, as he had never taken seriously the idea that his mother might actually die. She was invulnerable and larger than life itself. Her death was a hypothetical thing, something that had no actual bearing on reality.</p><p>And now she was gone and he was supposed to be King? He was to carry on the rebellion on his own?</p><p>He could just imagine the usurper upon his throne in the capital, laughing uproariously when he received the news of Maric's succession. Better to die here, he thought. Better that they put a sword through his gut, just as they had done to his mother, than to become the laughingstock of Ferelden. Maybe they would find some distant relative to take up the banner of rebellion. And if not, then it was best to let the bloodline of King Calenhad the Great die here. Let it end with the Rebel Queen falling just short of her goal--rather than petering out under the leadership of her inept son.</p><p>There was a certain amount of peace in that thought. Maric lay there on his back, the damp coldness of the leaves and mud almost comforting against his skin. The irregular shouts of the men drew nearer, but it was almost possible for Maric to blot them out. He tried to focus solely on the rustling of the leaves in the wind overhead. The tall trees stood all around him, like giant shadows peering down at the tiny figure who had tumbled at their feet. He could smell the pine, the tartness of nearby tree sap. These forest sentinels would be the only witnesses to his death.</p><p>And as he lay there, the pain in his head dulling to an insistent throb, the thought rankled. The men who had lured his mother here with promises of aid were nobles of Ferelden, the sort who had bent knee to the Orlesians so they could keep their lands. Rather than finally live up to their ancestral oaths, they had betrayed their rightful Queen. If no one escaped to inform those who had remained with the rebel army about what had actually happened, they might never know the truth. They would guess, but what could they do without proof? The traitors might never pay for their crime.</p><p>Maric sat up, his throbbing head protesting fiercely. Aching and shivering, he was wet and chilled right to the bone. Getting his bearings was difficult, but he guessed he was not far from the edge of the forest. He had stumbled only a short ways in, and the men chasing him were not far away, searching and calling out to each other. Their voices were getting fainter, however. Maybe he should just remain still? He was in some kind of a depression, and if he stayed there long enough, these men could pass him by, giving him enough time to catch his breath. Perhaps he could find his way back to the clearing and see if any of his mother's men had survived.</p><p>A sudden crunch of twigs nearby made him stop again. Maric listened carefully in the darkness for an agonizing moment, but heard nothing. The noise had been a footstep; he was sure of it. He waited longer, not daring to move a muscle .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and heard it again. Quieter, this time. Someone was definitely trying to sneak up on him. Maybe they could see him, even if he couldn't see them?</p><p>Maric cast about desperately. The far side of the hollow he was in opened up into a downward slope. It was difficult to tell the general terrain with so little moonlight coming through the canopy. There were also trees in that direction, roots and thick bushes that would prevent him from crawling out of sight. He either had to stay where he was .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or climb out.</p><p>A squelch of wet leaves nearby forced Maric as low to the ground as he could go. Listening closely was difficult given the muted shouting in the distance and the sound of the wind blowing high in the trees, but he could ever so faintly detect the soft steps of someone passing nearby. He suspected they couldn't see him at all. In fact, it was dark enough that his pursuer would likely end up doing exactly what Maric had done and fall right into the hollow.</p><p>Maric didn't exactly relish the idea of his enemy falling on top of him, so he cautiously tried to get up onto his feet. Sharp pain lanced through his knees and arms. There were cuts on his face and hands from the branches, and he was sure there was a gash on his head .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but it all felt distant, as if someone else were experiencing the pain. He tried to control his movements, making them slow and quiet. Smooth. And he continued to listen for more footsteps, anxiously biting his lower lip. It was difficult to hear anything over the desperate thumping of his heart. Surely it was obvious to whoever was out there. Perhaps they were closing in for the kill even now, laughing at his terror.</p><p>Breathing deliberately, sweating despite the chill, Maric slowly pulled himself upright enough to get both his feet underneath him. His right knee spasmed, ...</p></p><h2>The House Next Door (Hardcover Library Edition)</h2><p><b>THE WORLD'S #1 BESTSELLING WRITER - 3 pulse-pounding thrillers in 1 book!<br></b> <br><b>The House Next Door (with Susan DiLallo): </b>Married mother of three Laura Sherman was thrilled when her new neighbor invited her on some errands.

The Kisoji, which runs through the Kiso Valley in the Japanese Alps, has been in use since at least 701 C.E. In the seventeenth century, it was the route that the daimyo (warlords) used for their biennial trips&#x2014;along with their samurai and porters&#x2014;to the new capital of Edo (now Tokyo). The natural beauty of the route is renowned&#x2014;and famously inspired the landscapes of Hiroshige, as well as the work of many other artists and writers. Wilson, esteemed translator of samurai philosophy, has walked the road several times and is a delightful and expert guide to this popular tourist destination; he shares its rich history and lore, literary and artistic significance, cuisine and architecture, as well as his own experiences.</p><p>WILLIAM SCOTT WILSON is the foremost translator into English of traditional Japanese texts on samurai culture. His best-selling translations include <i>Hagakure</i>, <i>The Book of Five Rings</i>, and <i>Taiko</i>. He is also the author of <i>The Lone Samurai</i>, a biography of the legendary samurai Miyamoto Musashi, and <i>The One Taste of Truth</i>, on the history of tea and Zen.From the introduction:<br><br>"The Kiso Road--the <i>Kisoji</i> in Japanese--runs about sixty miles through central Nagano Prefecture and mostly follows first the Narai and then the Kiso River (traveling from north to south) through the granite forest-covered mountains of that same name. It is the heart of the longer 340-mile road, the Nakasendo (also called the <i>Kisokaido</i>), which stretches from Tokyo to Kyoto. It is called a 'road,' and it often runs parallel to or on Highway 19 but just as often wanders into the mountains as a smaller paved road or just a narrow path of dirt or ancient paving stones. The Kisoji has been in use for perhaps over two thousand years, although it was most popular as a thoroughfare during the sixteenth through nineteenth centuries, when travelers walked, rode on horseback, or were carried in palanquins through the mountains, along scary suspension bridges built on cliffs overlooking the swift river, and over the steep passes. <br><br>"It is not too easy to get lost on this road, although it can be done, as I have sometimes proven; markers are posted along the way in Japanese, English, Korean, and Chinese because the authorities do not want to go looking for you. There are also eleven villages, established in 1601 as post towns, about six to seven miles apart, where the modern hiker can stop for the night in traditional inns just as his counterparts did far back into the past. And, although there are sometimes quick gains and drops in elevation as the road meanders through the mountains, even people in moderate shape can walk the entire sixty miles in less than a week. My preference, however, is to take it at a much more moderate pace. The beauty of the mountains and rivers, and the experience of the traditional baths, cuisine, and bedding in the inns are not to be rushed through. <br><br>"This account is also somewhat of a story map. Over the years that I've traveled the Kisoji, I've been lucky enough to meet with a number of people--innkeepers, coffee shop owners, farmers, Buddhist priests, and hikers like myself--who have generously shared their knowledge of the rich history, traditions, and folklore of the area. Because of the antiquity of the road--it is first mentioned in a Japanese chronicle dated 701 CE--there are also a number of books that describe not only the geography and topography of the road, but also local spots inhabited by ghosts and animals like foxes and badgers that bewitch the unwary traveler, or that are famous for some romantic or tragic event. These guidebooks, many of which were written in the early 1800s when the Kiso Road was at its greatest popularity, were intended for the inquisitive traveler of those times, and are still wonderfully informative. Poets and journalists such as Basho and Shiki also loved traveling the Kiso Road, and, along with excerpts from the early guidebooks, I have included a number of their poetic impressions, many by Santoka, the shabby Zen priest/haiku poet/sake drinker, whose presence I felt constantly. <br><br>"In this way, the territory covered here is not just geographical, the time line not limited, and the hike not mine alone."</p><h2>Chinese Lattice Designs (Dover Pictorial Archive)</h2><p><p>Chinese craft design excelled in the manipulation of geometric space and reached its highest point in the design of window lattices on Chinese houses. Long recognized as an important folk art, window lattices have been generally neglected as an art form and this book is the first work on the subject since the 17th century. Fortunately, it is also the definitive work on the subject, and though no book can present a complete coverage of Chinese lattice, this book is a great classic study and an incredibly rich source of design for Westerners.<br>More than 1200 designs are shown here, arranged in a clear system of classification that includes 22 areas of related design &#x2014; borders, brackets, tail pieces, and so on. The lattices are classified according to one basic figure or concept, and the hundreds of beautiful design variations fall into only 26 categories: parallelogram, octagon or octagon square, hexagon, single focus frames, double focus frames, triple focus frames, quintuple focus frames, no focus frames, wedge-lock, presentation, out-lock, in-out bound, the Han line, parallel waves, opposed waves, recurving wave, loop-continued, like swastikas (a Buddhist symbol), unlike swastikas, central Ju I, allover Ju I, S-scroll, U-scroll, rustic ice-ray, symmetrical ice-ray, and square and round. Each category is introduced in sections at the front. In addition, there is usually a short description for each design and every design is designated by name, location, and approximate date of construction.<br>Professor Dye spent over 21 years studying and copying lattices all over China, and because of the ravages of time and changing cultural values, this collection can probably never be duplicated. Balanced, intricate, sometimes asymmetrical, usually harmonious, these lattice designs present a wealth of material for the Western commercial artist, textile designer, pattern-maker, and craftsman. Reflecting their Chinese heritage, these designs are universal and can be used almost anywhere.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Pirates 1660&#x2013;1730 (Elite)</h2><p>This book gives an accurate picture of the pirates who sailed in the waters of the Caribbean and off the American coastline during the &#39;golden age&#39; of piracy between 1660 and 1730. It traces the origins of piratical activity in the 16th century and examines the Boucaneer (Buccaneer) culture in Jamaica and Hispaniola. It details what drove individuals to a life of piracy, how they dressed, their weaponry, the ships they used and the codes by which they operated. Whether viewed as villains or victims the Pirates were a major threat to shipping and commerce in the western Atlantic for more than 70 years.</p><p>An unrivalled illustrated reference source on fighting men and commanders, past and present.

In this collection of talks, informal counsel, and personal reminiscences, Sri Daya Mata shares the guidance and inspiration she receieved as a close disciple of Paramahansa Yogananda, one of the preeminent spiritual figures of our time and author of the widely acclaimed <i>Autobiography of a Yogi.</i> <p>This anthology conveys the in-depth guidance she absorbed during her more than twenty years of day-to-day association with the great teacher: the practices and principles that lead to realization of the infinite love and joy that are hidden within every human being, just waiting to be discovered.</p></p><p>Sri Daya Mata, one of Paramahansa Yogananda's earliest and closest disciples, was the president of Self-Realization Fellowship/Yogoda Satsanga Society of India from 1955 until her passing in 2010. Born Faye Wright on January 31, 1914, in Salt Lake City, Utah, Daya Mata met Paramahansa Yogananda at the age of seventeen when she attended a lecture series he was giving in her hometown. Upon hearing him speak, she inwardly thought: "This man loves God as I have always longed to love Him. He knows God. Him I shall follow." Not long afterward, she entered his ashram in Los Angeles as a nun of the Self-Realization Order. During more than two decades of day-to-day association with Sri Yogananda, Daya Mata served as his confidential secretary; and over the years he entrusted her with increasing spiritual and administrative responsibilities. From the beginning he singled her out for a special role, and he encouraged other disciples to pattern their lives after her example. As Paramahansa Yogananda's spiritual successor, Sri Daya Mata guided his society for more than fifty years, faithfully carrying out his wishes and ideals for the dissemination of his teachings worldwide and for the establishment of Self-Realization Fellowship temples, centers, and retreats. She made several global speaking tours, including extended visits to India. Under her leadership, the pioneering spiritual work of Paramahansa Yogananda flourished, both in his native land and around the world. Two anthologies of her lectures and informal talks have been published, <i>Only Love: Living the Spiritual Life in a Changing World</i>, and <i>Finding the Joy Within You: Personal Counsel for God-Centered Living</i>. Many of her talks are also available on CD and DVD. A true mother of compassion as her name signified, Sri Daya Mata inspired truth-seekers of all faiths and from all walks of life.</p><h2>After Atlas (A Planetfall Novel)</h2><p><b>Acclaimed author Emma Newman returns to the captivating universe she created in <i>Planetfall</i> with a stunning science fiction mystery where one man&#x2019;s murder is much more than it seems&#x2014;an Arthur C.

I'll make a casserole, I promise myself, like a parent promising a grumbling toddler he'll get a toy if he behaves. There's some beef left in the freezer. And if there's flour (I try not to get my hopes up), I'll make dumplings, stodgy and crisped on the top like the Brits make them. I haven't eaten since an early and inadequate breakfast, and just imagining what that casserole could smell like makes me close my eyes and smile to myself, just for a moment. I turn my collar up and tuck my hands back into my pockets. I'm hoping that here in this little nook no one will see me and feel they're entitled to come and talk to me just because they've seen me on the news and docu-feeds.<br><br>A woman walks in front of the doorway and looks straight at me, pausing midstride as if she's listening for something I'm about to say. I pull back into the shadows when she laughs, worried that she's recognized me, before realizing she's talking to an avatar projected by her chip. She's experiencing walking with a friend, chatting and laughing away. When I shift to the other side of the doorway she blinks with a yelp, seeing me for the first time, and mutters an apology in Norwegian.<br><br>I rest my head against the door behind me, waiting for my pulse to settle again.<br><br>"Would you like to play a game while you're waiting?" Tia asks.<br><br>"No." Now I'm the one looking like I'm talking to myself. Not that it matters. Most of the people I can see in this dingy London backstreet are talking to either projected avatars or, like me, just the voices of their Artificial Personal Assistants, delivered directly into their brains via neural implant.<br><br>"We're next to a node for a new urban-enhancement game with a free trial to-"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"Would you like me to stop making urban-environment interactivity suggestions when you are off duty?"<br><br>"Yes. Why are you making them, anyway?"<br><br>"A recent change in the licensing agreement between-"<br><br>"Save it, Tia. I don't need to know." It's the first rule of any change to a licensing agreement: it's not for the benefit of the end user, no matter what they say.<br><br>Where the fuck is the van?<br><br>I check the time and it's only five p.m. It feels like two in the morning. There's a steady pounding throb at the back of my head, and my hunger has moved from gnawing, through occasional bouts of light-headedness, to making me want to kill someone. Then I hear the low whine of the van's engine and step out as it parks, pulling my small wheeled case behind me, ready to muscle my way to the front when it opens its back doors.<br><br>Everyone in the loitering crowd has their public profile set to private, as do I. I recognize some of them from other markets. There's the man with the tiny dog that bites anyone who goes near, the little shit. There's the woman with the umbrella that's almost taken my eye out several times, and she knows she's doing it but has no fucks to give for a rival consumer. There's the old dear who looks like she could be the sweetest grandma straight out of a department store Christmas mersive advert, but I know she's just as willing to grind her bootheels into someone else's toes if they push too much from the back.<br><br>The driver gets out, moves to the side of the van and slides the side door across just enough to pull out the folding table, while his passenger jumps out and scans the street. They've just made a delivery to a supermarket down the road, one that's-like all of them-too expensive for most people to shop in. It has aisles filled with perfect vegetables and a counter with the freshest meat-actual real meat cut from real animals-all sparkling and brightly lit. I only know about it because of the mersive adverts that weasel their way in every few months or so before Tia closes the loophole they've exploited to get to me. Cooking with real, fresh food is the province of the rich. Rich enough to buy it, or rich enough to have the space for dirt to grow it, or rich enough to hire space and equipment to have other people grow it just for them.<br><br>This impromptu market is a testament to mankind's ability to exploit every possible consumer niche. The driver has come from a wholesaler who has realized that there are people willing to pay good money for the stock that the supermarkets won't take. So all the rejects get put into boxes and loaded onto the last delivery of the day, to be sold in a backstreet that smells of piss and misery. Now it's filled with people who are doing well enough to spend money on food items considered luxuries, but not quite well enough to afford to do it in a nice building with beautiful staff and real champagne given at the door.<br><br>I'm not doing well enough to have the money to do this. I've made greater sacrifices to get this food. I doubt any of the others have given up years of freedom to be able to buy a few misshapen vegetables every week. I frown to myself, trying to stop thinking that way. I try to reframe it, the way Dee would. "It was a shitty choice," she'd say. "But at least it was one you got to make for yourself."<br><br>It doesn't have the same effect when she's not here with me. No matter how much I try to spin it into something else, it doesn't alter the sheer injustice of it all. But as much as I want it to, my sacrifice doesn't give me a place at the front of the jostling throng that is slowly, reluctantly morphing into a queue. In moments I find myself behind the old woman and take care where I'm putting my feet. The man with the dog is farther back, his irritation expressed perfectly by the tiny, vicious snarling of the overgrown rat in his arms. There's a sharp, painful tap on the top of my head and I twist to see the woman with the umbrella.<br><br>"So sorry," she says with a fake smile.<br><br>"It's not raining," I say through gritted teeth.<br><br>"Oh, has it stopped?" She pretends not to have noticed and still doesn't fold the damn thing away. There's a slight narrowing of her eyes as she stares at me and I face front again, worrying that she's thinking she's seen me somewhere before.<br><br>I turn my collar up as if against the wind, but it's more to cover as much of my face as possible. Crates of produce have been hauled out of the van and the driver has cranked one open already. He scoops out a few carrots, all huge, malformed things, looking like fetishes from some ancient magical ritual. He holds one up for the crowd, who laugh when they see how much it looks like a man running, with its split root and arm-like offshoots. Turnips are dumped next to them, then onions. It's as if the universe knew I wanted to cook a casserole.<br><br>"No need to push," the driver calls. "Plenty for sale tonight. Cooking apples too, when this doughnut"-he jerks a thumb at his assistant-"digs 'em out for ya."<br><br>Tia informs me that the seller's APA has made contact and the handshake has been successful. All I need to do is pick what I want and our APAs will handle the rest. I swipe away a notification warning me that the ingredients I plan to buy will amount to an extra three hours on my contract to pay off the credit required.<br><br>The queue shuffles forward as the first purchases are swiftly made. Only four people away from the table, I'm already earmarking the ones I hope will still be there when it's my turn. The seller glances down the line, sees me and winks. A recorded audio message comes in from him moments later and I give Tia permission to play it to me.<br><br>"I got some flour in the van for you and some sugar. You need to sieve 'em 'cos they was spillages, but it's all good 'cos it's a clean processing plant. No charge. My boy'll give 'em to ya round the front of the van after you got your veggies."<br><br>Has it been sent to me in error? The message continues.<br><br>"I know you was the copper who got that bloke who was killin' the babies up north. Saw it on the feed. I know 'im, I thought, he's the one who buys me veggies. So there's extra for you whenever you come. Just don't tell no one. Next time I'll bring some beef if I can sneak it out. I got a baby grandson, see? Same age as that young lad, the last one that bastard got."<br><br>The message ends, and for the first time in years I choose to seek out eye contact with another real human being because I genuinely want to. He meets my gaze and nods and I smile. I actually smile at someone I don't know. He looks away to serve the next customer and I'm left reeling from the body blow of the first act of kindness I can remember in years.<br><br>The queue moves forward again, and even though the umbrella hits my head once more I don't have any anger left in me now. I ignore it and wait with newfound patience. There will be something left for me by the time I get there; I know it now.<br><br>Minutes pass and then the hairs on the back of my neck prickle. I have the distinct impression someone is watching me. It's not the woman behind me-I can hear her arguing with the man behind her, who's also been hit by the umbrella. It's someone else. I tuck my chin into my coat and whisper to Tia.<br><br>"Who's in this crowd?"<br><br>"Everyone within a ten-meter radius, with the exception of the driver and sales assistant, have their public profiles set to private."<br><br>"Read them anyway."<br><br>"You are not currently assigned to a case. Please state your justification."<br><br>I can't give the real reason, so I need to lie. If I push it too far, my breach of their personal privacy will be flagged in the system. "Possible criminal activity in progress." I pause, hoping that's enough.<br><br>The gamble pays off; I'm in good standing at the Ministry of Justice and there's nothing in the system to suggest I ever abuse my privileges, so it gives me the benefit of the doubt. Tia pulls in the information that all the people around me would display about themselves if they had their profiles set to public, overlaying it across my vision as if the text is floating above the tarmac next to me. Before I even have the chance to scan the list, Tia highlights one and pulls it to the front, in line with a command I programmed years ago. That profile is now larger than the rest with a single keyword flashing.<br><br>Journalist.<br><br>Oh JeeMuh. Oh fuck, no. Not now.<br><br>The omnipresent paranoia ratchets up a gear and my palms start to sweat. He must have followed me from the train station, old-school style. I read his profile and select the link to his portfolio. He's written several pieces about the Pathfinder. Of course he has; half of the journalists alive now have written some bullshit about that crazy woman who built a spaceship called Atlas and took the faithful off into space to find God. His most recent piece is an article on the capsule they left behind to be opened forty years later that will soon be opened, the one I've instructed Tia to remove all mentions of from my feeds. The grand opening is less than two weeks away and the speculation about its contents has gone from occasional and irritating to constant and unbearable.<br><br>I force myself to appear calm, telling myself that I overreact to these people, and if I don't get a lid on this soon, it could be reported to my psych supervisor.<br><br>"Show him in the crowd, Tia."<br><br>A small blue arrow appears at the right-hand edge of my vision and I twist until the arrow disappears and a bald black man in a heavy gray overcoat is outlined in blue. He's staring right at me and just a second of eye contact is sufficient to send my heart rate high enough to flash a notification from MyPhys. I look away as fast as I can, silently hoping he'll stay where he is.<br><br>It's a ridiculous hope.<br><br>There's only one person in front of me now, and the vegetables I've got my eye on are still there. I want to run but I need the food. I add a "Do not disturb" to my personal profile but I know it won't make any difference to that parasite. If anything, it'll probably make him even more keen to bother me. Journos are twisted sods.<br><br>He's walking over and I ball my fists in my pockets. I fix my attention on the table ahead, tucking my nose beneath the top rim of the turned-up collar, even though it won't do a thing. I have to satisfy this primal urge to duck and hide somehow.<br><br>"Mr. Moreno," he says, even though his APA will be reminding him of the DND notice on my profile.<br><br>"I don't have anything to say."<br><br>"I don't want to talk to you about the case."<br><br>I channel my contempt into a long sideways glance. "I know."</p><h2>Restoration (Walk in the Light, Volume 1)</h2><p>This book is the first of 12 in the highly acclaimed Walk in the Light Series written by Todd D. Bennett. Restoration examines the pagan influences that have impacted Christianity and Judaism. These two religions share common roots and claim to worship the same God while on distinctly different paths. Restoration explains how this division began and what must be done to heal the breach. This is a must read for any person who desires to understand the truth contained in the Scriptures.</p><p>Todd D. Bennett is an attorney and author who lives in upstate New York with his wife and two children. Over the years Todd has traveled extensively to the nation of Israel and around the world researching and teaching the Hebraic roots of Christianity.</p><h2>How to Live in the World and Still Be Happy</h2><p><p>So many things in life can cause us concern and worry: work, love, money, the things we own or don't own, physical appearance.

Until the mid-twentieth century, nearly all fly rods were bamboo. By the 1970s, fiberglass and graphite changed the world of fly-fishing. But more and more anglers are seeing bamboo rods in retail outlets, and want to give them a try. With this book, John Gierach, one of the nation's top fly-fishing writers, provides a philosophical guide to the angler who seeks this new &#x201c;old&#x201d; method. Gierach discusses how bamboo rods are built, how they differ from graphite rods, and how using one will change a fly fisher's approach to the sport. Fishing bamboo might be the pinnacle of fly-casting skill, and this book will help take you there.<br></p><p>John Gierach is the great sage of American fly fishing, an idiosyncratic philosopher whose commentaries on<br>angling are explorations of the meaning of life. He is also one of the most widely-read angling writers in<br>the country, mainly through his monthly columns in <i>Fly Rod &amp; Reel. </i>But his great books&#x2014;<i>Trout Bum,</i><br><i>Standing in a River Waving a Stick, </i>and <i>Sex, Death and Fly Fishing, </i>among others&#x2014;continue to attract<br>new and younger readers. For many fly fishers, he is the voice of their sport. He lives in Lyons, Colorado.</p><h2>This Place on Third Avenue</h2><p>A collection of hilarious, poignant, and eternal stories by the acclaimed writer who wrote for The New Yorker captures the off-beat, quirky, and amusing characters that he encountered at Tim and Joe Costello&#39;s Irish Saloon, from cab drivers, horseplayers, and glamour girls, to has-beens, never-weres, and dreamers. 25,000 first printing.</p><p>From 1937 until his death in 1956, John McNulty walked many beats for <i>The New Yorker</i>, but his favorite--and the one that he made famous--was Tim &amp; Joe Costello's, an old-fashioned Irish saloon at Third Avenue and Forty-fourth Street. The place is gone now--it was leveled and replaced by the lobby of a skyscraper in 1973-but it and its hard-living mid-century patrons live on in these twenty-eight immortal stories and sketches, many of them collected here for the first time.Atheist hit by truck By John McNulty <p>This drunk came down the street, walking in the gutter instead of on the sidewalk, and a truck hit him and knocked him down. </p><p>It is a busy corner there at Forty-second Street and Second Avenue, in front of the Shanty, and there&#x2019;s a hack line there. Naturally, a little crowd and a cop gathered around the drunk and some hackies were in the crowd. </p><p>The cop was fairly young. After he hauled the guy up and sat him down, he saw there wasn&#x2019;t much wrong with him. His pants were torn and maybe his knee was twisted slightly&#x2014;maybe cut. </p><p>The cop got out his notebook and began asking questions and writing the answers down. Between questions he had to prop the man up. Fellow gave his name&#x2014;Wilson, Martin, some noncommittal name&#x2014;and his address. Everybody around was interested in these facts. </p><p>The blind man in the newspaper hut felt a little put out because nobody was telling him what was going on, and he could hear beguiling fragments of it. &#x201c;What happen? What happen?&#x201d; the blind man kept asking, but the event wasn&#x2019;t deemed sensational enough for anybody to run and tell him, at least until afterward. </p><p>&#x201c;What religion are yuh?&#x201d; the policeman asked the man, who propped himself up this time and blurted out, &#x201c;Atheist! I&#x2019;m an atheist!&#x201d; </p><p>For some reason, a lot of people laughed. </p><p>&#x201c;Jeez, he&#x2019;s an atheist!&#x201d; one of the hackies said. He shouted to a comrade who was still sitting behind the wheel of a parked cab at the corner, &#x201c;Feller says he&#x2019;s an atheist!&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Wuddaya laughing at?&#x201d; the cop asked, addressing himself to the crowd generally. &#x201c;Says he&#x2019;s an atheist, so he&#x2019;s an atheist. Wuddaya laughing at?&#x201d; He wrote something in the book. </p><p>Another policeman, from over by Whelan&#x2019;s drugstore, where there was a picket line, strolled up. He was an older cop, more lines in his face, bigger belly, less humps around his hips, because the equipment&#x2014;twisters, mace, and all that stuff&#x2014;fitted on him better after all these years. &#x201c;Wuzzamadder with &#x2019;im?&#x201d; he asked his colleague. </p><p>&#x201c;This here truck hit him. He isn&#x2019;t hurt bad. Says he&#x2019;s an atheist.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I am an atheist!&#x201d; the man yelled. </p><p>The crowd laughed again. </p><p>&#x201c;Did you put that down&#x2014;atheist?&#x201d; the older cop asked. </p><p>&#x201c;Yuh, I put it in where it says &#x2018;religion.&#x2019; &#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Rubbid out. Rubbid out. Put in Cat&#x2019;lic. He looks like a Cat&#x2019;lic to me. He got an Irish name? Anyway, rubbid out. When he sobers up, he&#x2019;ll be sorry he said that atheist business. Put in Cat&#x2019;lic. We gotta send him to Bellevue just for safety&#x2019;s sake.&#x201d; The young cop started for the drugstore to put in a call. </p><p>&#x201c;Never mind safety&#x2019;s sake. I&#x2019;m an atheist, I&#x2019;m telling you,&#x201d; the drunk said, loud as he could. </p><p>&#x201c;Cuddid out, cuddid out,&#x201d; the older cop said. Then he leaned over like a lecturer or somebody. &#x201c;An&#x2019; another thing&#x2014;if you wouldn&#x2019;t go round sayin&#x2019; you&#x2019;re an atheist, maybe you wouldn&#x2019;t be gettin&#x2019; hit by trucks.&#x201d; </p><p>The crowd sensed a great moral lesson and didn&#x2019;t laugh. </p><p>&#x201c;Jeez! The guy says he&#x2019;s an atheist,&#x201d; the hackie said again. </p><p>A little later the Bellevue ambulance came. </p><p>&#x201c;I yam a natheist,&#x201d; the man kept muttering as they put him into the ambulance.</p></p><h2>The Foolishness of Preaching : Proclaiming the Gospel Against the Wisdom of the World</h2><p>Preachers, are you preaching authentically and effectively to your congregation? Those who sit in the pews, are you truly expecting and receiving genuine Gospel preaching? In The Foolishness of Preaching Robert Farrar Capon challenges preachers to preach faithfully and effectively to their congregations and challenges congregants to expect and demand genuine preaching. &#34;A passion for the Passion&#34; is the necessary ingredient for authentic preaching, declares Capon. A preacher must believe passionately in the Good News of salvation in Christ. Preachers often experience stumbling blocks preventing them from authentic preaching. In Part One, &#34;The Bedrock of Preaching,&#34; Capon discusses these stumbling blocks and ways to overcome them. In Part Two, &#34;The Practice of Preaching,&#34; Capon offers practical advice and insight into the mechanics of effective preaching. The Foolishness of Preaching is not simply a nuts-and-bolts exercise in preaching, but a lively and challenging lesson that never loses touch with the center of preaching and belief-the astonishing grace of Jesus Christ.</p><p>In Part 1 of the book, &#34;The Bedrock of Preaching&#34;, Capon discusses how essential it is to have &#34;a passion for the Passion&#34; (to believe passionately in the Good News of salvation in Christ), how to overcome the stumbling blocks to genuinely accepting grace, and how to relinquish a false sense of control over our salvation. This part of the book also has important things to say to those of us who listen to sermons and who look to the pulpit for words of grace and hope that are truly meaningful to our lives today. In Part 2, &#34;The Practice of Preaching&#34;, Capon concentrates on the mechanics of preaching in anything but a mechanical way. He begins by discussing the ingredients of preaching, emphasizing the importance of not just reading but really hearing the Word in the original Greek and Hebrew, and offers some pointed comments on the Common Lectionary. He then goes on to illustrate how to preach effectively from notes, giving specific, day-by-day suggestions for preparation. He also shows, using the full text of one of his sermons as an example, how to preach from a more fully written manuscript and explains how to move from first notes to final notes for a sermon, again using some of his own notes as an example.</p><h2>Yoga for the Special Child: A Therapeutic Approach for Infants and Children with Down Syndrome, Cerebral Palsy, Autism Spectrum Disorders and Learning Disabilities</h2><p>An innovative and easy-to-follow program for parents, educators, yoga teachers, and health care professionals.

The result is <i>Persistence: All Ways Butch and Femme</i>. The stories in these pages resist simple definitions. The people in these stories defy reductive stereotypes and inflexible categories.

Smith (<i>Cumberland</i>), and Zoe Whittall (<i>Bottle Rocket Hearts</i>) explore the parameters, history, and power of a multitude of butch and femme realities. It's a raucous, insightful, sexy, and sometimes dangerous look at what the words butch and femme can mean in today&#x2019;s ever-shifting gender landscape, with one eye on the past and the other on what is to come.</p><p>Includes a foreword by Joan Nestle, renowned femme author and editor of <i>The Persistent Desire: A Femme-Butch Reader</i>, a landmark anthology originally published in 1992.</p><p><b>Ivan E.

Meanwhile, the world order is teetering on the brink. North Korea is on the verge of having a nuclear weapon that could reach all of the United States, Russians have mastered a new form of information warfare that undercuts democracy, and the role of China in the global community remains unclear. There will always be value to experience and expertise, devotion to facts, humility in the face of complexity, and a respect for ideas, but in this moment they seem more important, and more endangered, than they've ever been. American Intelligence--the ultimate truth teller--has a responsibility in a post-truth world beyond merely warning of external dangers, and in <i>The Assault on Intelligence</i>, General Michael Hayden takes up that urgent work with profound passion, insight and authority.<br> <br>It is a sobering vision. The American intelligence community is more at risk than is commonly understood, for every good reason. Civil war or societal collapse is not necessarily imminent or inevitable, but our democracy's core structures, processes, and attitudes are under great stress. Many of the premises on which we have based our understanding of governance are now challenged, eroded, or simply gone. And we have a President in office who responds to overwhelming evidence from the intelligence community that the Russians are, by all acceptable standards of cyber conflict, in a state of outright war against us, not by leading a strong response, but by shooting the messenger.<br> <br>There are fundamental changes afoot in the world and in this country. <i>The Assault on Intelligence </i>shows us what they are, reveals how crippled we've become in our capacity to address them, and points toward a series of effective responses. Because when we lose our intelligence, literally and figuratively, democracy dies.</p><p>Michael Hayden is a retired United States Air Force four-star general and former Director of the National Security Agency, Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence, and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. He is currently a principal at the Chertoff Group, a security consultancy founded by former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff. Hayden also serves as a Distinguished Visiting Professor at George Mason University's Schar School of Policy and Government and is the founder of the Hayden Center for Intelligence, Policy, and International Security there. He is the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Playing to the Edge</i>.&#x201c;For a longtime spook, Hayden is a breezy and direct writer. He reduces complex issues of cyber and information warfare to essentials, and his polemic is leavened with humor and sympathy. He is at his best, though, when he shifts to a purely analytical tone. He coolly forecasts the direction of America under Trump, explains the intelligence that foreign governments are likely to collect from the president&#x2019;s Twitter feed and describes the benefits Russia drew from the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Kremlin-connected Russian attorneys and senior Trump campaign officials.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014; <i><b>The New York Times&nbsp;</b></i><br><br>&#x201c;The more important, absorbing and disturbing aspect of Hayden&#x2019;s book is the analysis from his professional perspective of what Trump and Trumpism mean for the intelligence community. It is sober, nuanced and, quite frankly, scary as hell.&#x201d; - <b>Mark Galeotti, <i>Washington Post</i></b></p><h2>First Manhattans: A History of the Indians of Greater New York</h2><p><p><em>A concise history of the Indians said to have sold Manhattan for $24</em></p> <p>The Indian sale of Manhattan is one of the world's most cherished legends. Few people know that the Indians who made the fabled sale were Munsees whose ancestral homeland lay between the lower Hudson and upper Delaware river valleys. The story of the Munsee people has long lain unnoticed in broader histories of the Delaware Nation.</p> <p><em>First Manhattans</em>, a concise and lively distillation of the author's comprehensive <em>The Munsee Indians,</em> resurrects the lost history of this forgotten people, from their earliest contacts with Europeans to their final expulsion just before the American Revolution. Anthropologist Robert S. Grumet rescues from obscurity Mattano, Tackapousha, Mamanuchqua, and other Munsee sachems whose influence on Dutch and British settlers helped shape the course of early American history in the mid-Atlantic heartland. He looks past the legendary sale of Manhattan to show for the first time how Munsee leaders forestalled land-hungry colonists by selling small tracts whose vaguely worded and bounded titles kept courts busy&#x2015;and settlers out&#x2015;for more than 150 years.</p> <p>Ravaged by disease, war, and alcohol, the Munsees finally emigrated to reservations in Wisconsin, Oklahoma, and Ontario, where most of their descendants still live today. With the four hundredth anniversary of Hudson's voyage to the river that bears his name, this book shows how Indians and settlers struggled, through land deals and other transactions, to reconcile cultural ideals with political realities. It offers a wide audience access to the most authoritative treatment of the Munsee experience&#x2015;one that restores this people to their place in history.</p></p><p><p><strong>Robert S. Grumet,</strong> anthropologist and retired National Park Service archeologist, is a Senior Research Associate with the McNeil Center for Early American Studies at the University of Pennsylvania. His numerous publications include <em>The Lenapes and Historic Contact: Indian People and Colonists in Today's Northeastern United States in the Sixteenth through Eighteenth Centuries.</em></p>As the story goes, canny Dutch traders purchased Manhattan for a pittance and established a world commercial capital. For the Munsee Indians, however, the 1624 transaction was merely the first of a long string of bad deals that ceded ancestral lands, resources, and eventually most of the cultural life of indigenous peoples in the greater New York area. Grumet, an anthropologist, meticulously reconstructs the creeping progress of European settlement, offering a definitive account of how the Munsees endured &#34;affronts and abuses and held on to what they could.&#34; It&#39;s an admirable historical reconstruction, but rarely a lively one. Most of the narrative is based on colonial records that give little sense of the cultures that were in such fundamental conflict. While &#34;nakedly manipulative deed deals done at the time were cynically dipped in drink and deceit,&#34; little context is conveyed in the author&#39;s prose. The 150 years of displacement and disfranchisement has a less dramatic historical context than other episodes in the history of European settlement of North America, but the Munsees met their fate early, and this account revives a vital part of New York history that would otherwise be consigned to obscurity.

Only in Hong Kong would a man at a cocktail party pick up a woman with the line "What do you think of the dollar?" And only in <i>Video Night in Kathmandu</i> will you find detailed, unsettling portraits of a Far East in flux as experienced by Pico Iyer, a travel writer beyond compare. Tibet, China, India, and Thailand--these are among the objects of Iyer's wanderlust, the subjects of 11 essays chronicling his travels. In India, he explores the lucrative Bombay film business: "The process of turning an American movie into an Indian one was not very difficult ... but it did require a few changes.... the Indian hero had to be domesticated, supplied with a father, a mother, and a clutch of family complications." As one film director told him, " ... for example, Rambo must be given a sister who was raped." In Bangkok he finds the sex trade is well nigh impossible to avoid: " ... by the time a third official government tout approached me with the novel invitation: 'My friend. You no like birdwatching?' I was inclined to suspect that ornithology was not among his interests." <p> Pico Iyer is more than just a travel writer. For four years, he wrote about world affairs for <i>Time</i>, and he brings to these brilliant, comical, and poignant essays his extensive knowledge of politics and culture as well as a journalist's eye for the telling details. <i>Video Night in Kathmandu</i> provides both a stark, unsettling view of modern Asia and an exploration of the ambivalent attitudes Asians hold toward the West.</p>11 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>River and Desert Plants of the Grand Canyon</h2><p>The Grand Canyon's isolation, great elevational range, and position at the convergence of three North American Deserts--the Mojave, Sonoran, and Great Basin--have created unique habitats for an unusual assemblage of plants.

We are led on a tour through the circle of the zodiac and spiritual hierarchies, and shown how they form a path from Jesus to Christ. The author further explains that the Starry Script is a key to anthroposophical Christology, and shows how it relates to the conception of the First Goetheanum. Prokofieff guides us imaginatively through the interior of Steiner&#x2019;s architectural masterpiece (destroyed by fire at the end of 1922), whose structure and decorations are seen to constitute a coherent esoteric map. Our task now, he suggests, is to rebuild the First Goetheanum within ourselves and, through a new form of self-development, work toward a truly modern path of initiation. <br><br> Supplementary essays focus on the cosmic aspects of Sophia as well as the being of Michael.

He wrote his first book, <i>Rudolf Steiner and the Founding of the New Mysteries,</i> while living in Soviet Russia, and it was published in English in 1994. After the fall of Communism, he helped establish the Anthroposophical Society in Russia.

Perhaps, inevitably, these images are of white men (and more rarely, women). It was not until the 1970s that African American superheroes such as Luke Cage, Blade, and others emerged. But as this exciting new collection reveals, these superhero comics are only one small component in a wealth of representations of black characters within comic strips, comic books, and graphic novels over the past century.&nbsp;<br><br><i>The Blacker the Ink</i> is the first book to explore not only the diverse range of black characters in comics, but also the multitude of ways that black artists, writers, and publishers have made a mark on the industry. Organized thematically into &#x201c;panels&#x201d; in tribute to sequential art published in the funny pages of newspapers, the fifteen original essays take us on a journey that reaches from the African American newspaper comics of the 1930s to the Francophone graphic novels of the 2000s. Even as it demonstrates the wide spectrum of images of African Americans in comics and sequential art, the collection also identifies common character types and themes running through everything from the strip <i>The Boondocks</i> to the graphic novel <i>Nat Turner</i>.&nbsp;<br><br> Though it does not shy away from examining the legacy of racial stereotypes in comics and racial biases in the industry, <i>The Blacker the Ink</i> also offers inspiring stories of trailblazing African American artists and writers. Whether you are a diehard comic book fan or a casual reader of the funny pages, these essays will give you a new appreciation for how black characters and creators have brought a vibrant splash of color to the world of comics. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>FRANCES GATEWARD is an associate professor in the department of cinema and television arts at California State University-Northridge.

Focusing on the changes to their work and personal styles that resulted from their meeting to the culmination of their efforts, the ballet The Rite of Spring, the story conveys their composition process in a lively, upbeat fashion, with a percussive vocabulary. This book would be the perfect accompaniment in music lessons exploring the 100th anniversary of the famous work, and may inspire young musicians to create their own and definitely different work. Children may be surprised to learn about the commotion the composition caused, and the riotous ballet is sure to catch their attention. Vibrantly colored illustrations, inspired by Matisse and Picasso, of the musical notes, instruments, and dancers depicted, enhance the tone of the story and complement the text well.

Nicholas Morath, former Hungarian cavalry officer, returns home to his young mistress in the 7th arrondissement. He&#39;s been in Vienna where, amid the mobs screaming for Hitler, he&#39;s done a quiet favour for his uncle, Count Janos Polanyi. Polanyi is a diplomat and, desperate to stop his country&#39;s drift into alliance with Nazi Germany, he trades in conspiracy - with SS renegades, Abwehr officers, British spies and NKVD defectors, leading Morath deeper and deeper into danger as Europe edges towards war.</p><p><b>Penzler Pick, January 2001:</b> The thrillers of Alan Furst usually take place in the dark days preceding World War II, but while the main participants in that war are of course portrayed, Britain, France, Germany, and the United States do not usually star in Furst's novels. He prefers instead to focus his stories on the citizens of those countries whose allegiances and roles in that particular theater of operations are much more contradictory and conflicted.<p> <i>Kingdom of Shadows</i> is set in Paris during 1938 and 1939. It is unclear at that time what the fate of Hungary will be if Hitler has his way, but a small group of expatriates would like to insure that events turn out in their country's favor. Nicholas Morath is an Hungarian aristocrat who fought bravely in the Great War. He is now part owner of an advertising agency in Paris, while his uncle, Count Janos Polanyi, is a minor diplomat stationed in Paris. Polanyi calls on Nicholas to take part in missions against the Hungarian Fascists: carrying letters or bringing individuals back across the border in the course of his business trips.</p><p> As Nicholas's dinner parties, business deals, and dalliances with his mistress start to take a back seat to the escalating crisis in Europe, his tasks become more complicated, dangerous, and bewildering to him. He knows far less than the reader, who understands that his actions will have far-reaching consequences even beyond the fate of Hungary. Nicholas just does what he can without the luxury of historic hindsight.</p><p> Furst has fashioned here an elegant gem that vividly portrays the city of Paris during the last peaceful days of 1938 and the menace of Hitler's ambitions in the Sudetenland and beyond. Nicholas Morath is a charismatic and sympathetic figure who will come to understand, as the war progresses, the consequences, both good and bad, of his smallest actions during that turbulent time. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p>"Furst&#x2019;s writing has the seductive shimmer of an urbane black-and-white Hollywood classic."<br>--<i>The New York Times</i><br><br>"Astonishingly, Alan Furst is not yet a household name.

In Paris, Fondane worked at an insurance company and for Paramount Pictures while establishing himself as a poet and philosopher writing in French. Under the guidance of the Russian �migr� philosopher Lev Shestov, Fondane became a leading exponent of existential philosophy in the 1930s.

His biography of Adolf Hitler has reached millions of readers around the world. Born in 1926, Fest experienced firsthand the rise of the Nazis, the Second World War, and a catastrophically defeated Germany, thus becoming a vital witness to these difficult years.<br><br>In this memoir of his childhood and youth, Fest offers a far-reaching view of how he experienced the war and National Socialism. True to the German <i>Bildung </i>tradition, Fest grows up immersed in the works of Goethe, Schiller, M�rike, Rilke, Kleist, Mozart, and Beethoven. His father, a conservative Catholic teacher, opposes the Nazi regime and as a result loses his job and status. Fest is forced to move to a boarding school in the countryside that he despises, and in his effort to come to terms with his father&#x2019;s strong political convictions, he embarks on a tireless quest for knowledge and moral integrity that will shape the rest of his life and writing career.</p><p><p><b>Joachim Fest</b> was one of the most important authors and historians of the Federal Republic of Germany. From 1963 he worked as chief editor of Norddeutscher Rundfunk (North German Broadcasting), and from 1973 to 1993 as editor of the <i>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</i>. His biography <i>Hitler</i> (1974) has been translated into more than twenty languages. His other works include <i>Inside Hitler&#x2019;s Bunker</i> (2005), <i>Speer: The Final Verdict </i>(2002), and <i>Plotting Hitler&#x2019;s Death</i> (1996).<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Herbert A. Arnold</b> holds a PhD from the University of W�rzburg and is a professor emeritus of German and Letters at Wesleyan University.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Martin Chalmers&#x2019;s</b> recent translations include <i>Summer Resort </i>by Esther Kinsky and<i> Brussels, the Gentle Monster: or the&nbsp;Disenfranchisement of Europe</i> by Hans Magnus Enzensberger. In 2004 he was awarded the Schlegel-Tieck Prize for <i>The Lesser Evil</i>, his translation of the post-1945 diaries of Victor Klemperer.</p>In early 1936, from our place by the wall, Wolfgang and I eavesdropped on a rare argument between our parents. There had been a strangely irritable atmosphere all day. My mother evidently started it, reminding my father in a few short sentences what she had put up with, politically and personally, in the last three years. She said she wasn&#x2019;t complaining, but she had never dreamt of such a future. From morning to night she was standing in front of pots, pans, and washboards, and when the day was over she had to attend to the torn clothes of the children, patched five times over. And then, after what seemed like a hesitant pause, she asked whether my father did not, after all, want to reconsider joining the Party. The gentlemen from the education authority had called twice in the course of the year to persuade him to give way; at the last visit they had even held out the prospect of rapid promotion. In any case, she couldn&#x2019;t cope anymore...And to indicate the end of her plea, after a long pause she added a simple &#x201c;Please!&#x201d;<br><br>My father replied a little too wordily (as I sometimes thought in the years to come), but at the same time revealed how uneasy he had been about the question for a long time. He said something about the readjustments that she, like many others, had been forced to make. He spoke about habit, which after often difficult beginnings provides a certain degree of stability. He spoke about conscience and trust in God. Also that he himself, as well as my brothers and I, could gradually relieve her of some of the work in the household, and so on. But my mother insisted on an answer, suggesting that joining the Party would not change anything: &#x201c;After all, we remain who we are!&#x201d; It did not take long for my father to retort: &#x201c;Precisely not! It would change everything!&#x201d;</p><h2>Seeds of Destruction</h2><p><b>Thomas Merton</b> (1915-1968) is one of the foremost spiritual thinkers of the twentieth century. Though he lived a mostly solitary existence as a Trappist monk, he had a dynamic impact on world affairs through his writing. An outspoken proponent of the antiwar and civil rights movements, he was both hailed as a prophet and castigated for his social criticism. He was also unique among religious leaders in his embrace of Eastern mysticism, positing it as complementary to the Western sacred tradition. Merton is the author of over forty books of poetry, essays, and religious writing, including <i>Mystics and Zen Masters</i>, and <i>The Seven Story Mountain</i>, for which he is best known. His work continues to be widely read to this day.</p><p><p><b>Thomas Merton,</b> a Trappist monk, is perhaps the foremost spiritual of the twentieth century. His diaries, social commentary, and spiritual writings continue to be widely read thirty years after his untimely death in 1968.</p>LETTERS TO A WHITE LIBERAL <br>Introductory Note <br>These &#x201c;Letters to a White Liberal&#x201d; were written during the early summer of 1963 and revised in the fall of the same year. As they approach publication in book form, a few remarks are needed to situate them in the context in which they will quite probably be read. <br>The developments that have taken place during 1964 have, if anything, substantiated everything these &#x201c;Letters&#x201d; attempted to say. <br>The Civil Rights bill has been passed, after the longest debate in the history of Congress, after the longest filibuster, after the most sustained and energetic efforts to prevent its becoming law. The new legislation is, in the main, worthy of praise. But, as the &#x201c;Letters&#x201d; point out, it is one thing to have a law on the books and another to get the law enforced when in practice not only the citizenry and &#x201c;Citizens&#x2019; Councils&#x201d; but the police, the state governments and the courts themselves are often in league against the Federal government. To what extent the law will remain a dead letter in the South, to what extent it will simply aggravate pressures and animosities in the North, where such righs are still guaranteed in theory more than in practice, is not quite possible to predict. <br>One thing is certain: since this law will not be entirely enforced, and since, even if it were perfectly enforced it would still not be able to meet critical problems that are more strictly economic and sociological (jobs, housing, delinquency, irresponsible violence), we are forced to admit that the Civil Rights legislation is not the end of the battle but only the beginning of a new and more critical phase in the conflict. <br>How comforting, how utopian a thought, if we could only convince ourselves that this new law marks the final victory in a patient and courageous struggle of moderate leaders, dedicated to non-violence and to scrupulous respect for social order and ethical principles! It is true of course that Birmingham and the Washington March in 1963 were symbolic of a long non-violent fight for rights. They marked the final stages of the campaign that made the Civil Rights bill an urgent necessity. <br>At the same time the systematic lawlessness and violence with which the opponents of Civil Rights legislation have set their own &#x201c;rights&#x201d; above those guaranteed by the law, have effectively undermined the respect which the Negroes themselves may have had for the legal and administrative agencies that are supposed to keep order and protect rights. Thus the struggle for the bill has also demonstrated that, in order to exercise the rights which the law protects, the Negro (and anyone else whose rights are in fact denied) is going to have to obtain some form of power. <br>Of course the law specifically removes obstacles to the registration and voting of Negroes, reaffirming that they should have access to the democratic exercise of power by ballot. Obviously, however, it is going to be a long time before Negroes can make full use of this particular form of power. And the use of molotov cocktails and bullets against them when they attempt to vote, unfortunately encourages them to prefer bullets to ballots themselves. <br>So it happens that now, after the passage of the bill, a new, tougher Negro leadership promises to emerge, no longer moderate and non-violent, and much more disposed to make sinister and effective use of the threat of force implied by the great concentration of frustrated, angry and workless Negroes in the ghettoes of the North. We can now expect violent, though perhaps disorganized and sporadic, initiatives in force around the edges of the Negro slums. This is already a familiar experience in some cities where, however, the violence has usually been designated under the rubric of &#x201c;deliquency&#x201d; rather than that of &#x201c;revolution.&#x201d; But let us not forget that delinquency itself is simply a spontaneous form of non-political protest and revolt. <br>When the Civil Rights bill passed, a Southern Senator tragically declared that this would &#x201c;only add to the hatred.&#x201d; He was of course right in foreseeing that after the bill became law the danger of hatred and violence would be even greater than before. But he was not necessarily right in attributing this to the law as such. He simply knew that the law had not ended the struggle. He knew well enough that the law had left the white South more deeply and grimly entrenched in its refusals. That the Negro, North and South, was more determined to take matters into his own hands, since he was convinced that even the liberal white man was not prepared to give him anything beyond fair promises and a certain abstract good will. <br>No one can be blind to the possibilities of violence in this situation. Though it is quite true that the vast majority both of whites and Negroes want to solve this problem without force and bloodshed, their &#x201c;wanting&#x201d; and their good intentions are no longer enough. It is also obvious that the majority of Americans were shocked and appalled by the senseless murder of President Kennedy. The fact remains that no matter who may have been guilty of actually shooting the President the murder grew out of the soil of hatred and violence that then existed and still exists in the South. It has been said often enough, but not too often, that the President had already been killed a thousand times over by the thoughts and the words, spoken or printed, of the racists. His death was something that had been meditated, imagined, desired and &#x201c;needed&#x201d; in a profound and savage way that made it in some sense inevitable. This was something that John F. Kennedy himself evidently did not understand, or he would have gone into Dallas that day with less confidence and better protection. It is also something that the majority of Americans still do not quite manage to believe. But it must be affirmed: where minds are full of hatred and where imaginations dwell on cruelty, torment, punishment, revenge and death, then inevitably there will be violence and death. <br>Why, in this particular crisis (and this applies to international politics as well as to domestic or economic upheaval), is there so much hatred and so dreadful a need for explosive violence? Because of the impotency and the frustration of a society that sees itself involved in difficulties which, though this may not consciously be admitted, promise to be insuperable. Actually, there is no reason why they should be insuperable, but as long as white society persists in clinging to its present condition and to its own image of itself as the only acceptable reality, then the problem will remain without reasonable solution, and there will inevitably be violence. <br>The problem is this: if the Negro, as he actually is (not the &#x201c;ideal&#x201d; and theoretical Negro, or even the educated and cultured Negro of the small minority), enters wholly into white society, then that society is going to be radically changed. This of course is what the white South very well knows, and it is what the white Liberal has failed to understand. Not only will there be a radical change which, whatever form it may take, will amount to at least a peaceful revolution, but also there will be enormous difficulties and sacrifices demanded of everyone, especially the whites. Obviously property values will be affected. The tempo of life and its tone will be altered. The face of business and professional life may change. The approach to the coming crucial labor and economic problems will be even more anguished than we have feared. The psychological adjustment alone will be terribly demanding, perhaps even more for Negroes than for whites in many cases. <br>These are things which the South is able to see. But their reality does not justify the conservative conclusion which clings blindly to the present impossible state of things, and determines to preserve it at any cost, even that of a new civil war. We must dare to pay the dolorous price of change, to grow into a new society. Nothing else will suffice! <br>The only way out of this fantastic impasse is for everyone to face and accept the difficulties and sacrifices involved, in all their seriousness, in all their inexorable demands. This is what our society, based on a philosophy of every man for himself and on the rejection of altruism and sacrifice (except in their most schematic and imaginary forms) is not able to do. Yet it is something which it must learn to do. It cannot begin to learn unless it knows the need to learn. These &#x201c;Letters&#x201d; attempt to demonstrate the reality of that need and the urgency of the situation. <br>I. If I dare to imagine that these letters may have some significance for both of us, it is because I believe that Christianity is concerned with human crises, since Christians are called to manifest the mercy and truth of God in history. <br>Christianity is the victory of Christ in the world&#x2014;that is to say, in history. It is the salvation of man in and through history, through temporal decisions made for love of Christ, the Redeemer and Lord of History. The mystery of Christ is at work in all human events, and our comprehension of secular events works itself out and expresses itself in that sacred history, the history of salvation, which the Holy Spirit teaches us to perceive in events that appear to be purely secular. We have to admit that this meaning is often provisional and sometimes beyond our grasp. Yet as Christians we are committed to an attempt to read an ultimate and transcendent meaning in temporal events that flow from human choices. To be specific, we are bound to search &#x201c;history,&#x201d; that is to say the intelligible actions of men, for some indications of their inner significance, and some relevance to our commitment as Christians. <br>&#x201c;History&#x201d; then is for us that complex of meanings which we read into the interplay of acts and decisions that make up our civilization. And we are also (this is more urgent still) at a turning point in the history of that European and American society which has been sha...</p><h2>In the Realm of the Wolf (Drenai Tales, Book 5)</h2><p>Enter the extraordinary, action-filled world that became Legend--<br>as the exciting Drenai adventure continues to unfold . . .<br><br>A mighty warrior and a feared assassin among the Drenai, Waylander the Slayer is now a man hunted by his own people--with a fortune in gold offered as grim reward for his murder.

Tolkien wrote back, Lamour passed away before David had any opportunity to contact him, and Stan Lee lived thousands of miles away from David's British home. One out of three wasn't bad, but it could be improved upon.<br><br>We were at the San Diego ComicCon, rustling up new readers, and David had just finished a two-hour continuous signing. A friend of mine spotted a familiar face, so I excused myself and darted away, returning a few moments later to say, "David Gemmell, I'd like you to meet Stan Lee." A tall, ruddy, and normally poised individual, David was struck speechless. Here was the man who, through his Marvel Comics stories, had reinvented the relationship between heroes and villains, forever blurring the barriers between good and evil. Before long the two fantasists were chatting away happily. Stan's wife, Joan, being British, was especially gracious to the London-born Gemmell.

His heroes are mighty swordsmen, ax-wielders, and post-apocalyptic adventurers.

But life (and the author) aren't that kind, and these heroes are forced out of retirement, forced to face bloody hordes of the undead, armies from Hell. Worse, his heroes are generally saddled with young, green heroes. (Nothing drives you crazy more than a cocky kid.) But they overcome, and the cocky kids become heroes, too.

Before telephones and webcams made separations easier, people had no choice but to entrust bits of their heart to the postman with every letter they sent. A lost letter could cause sleepless nights, a returned letter, even more. But a reply penned immediately, in a hot rush of emotion, could make the soul soar. <i>Letters from Skye</i> is a story about lovers and families separated by war, with nothing but pen and paper to hold everything together. </p> <p>I first wrote this book six years ago, while I was living in Edinburgh, Scotland. After my youngest was born, we escaped the city and went to the Isle of Skye for one gorgeous week. We stayed in a cottage on the beach and chased legends across the island in the rain. Evenings, I sprawled before the little peat coal fire with maps of Skye, tracing the coast and trying my tongue at the Gaelic. On the drive back to Edinburgh, a story came together in my head. The story of a woman bound to the poetry of Skye, held within those rocky coasts, being given a glimpse of the greater world with the unexpected arrival of an envelope. The story of a man, desperate to prove himself fearless, finding his only fear on the other end of those letters. The story of a daughter, trying to catch the past as it comes tumbling out of the wall. I scribbled notes right there in the car and started furiously writing when we got back home. </p> <p>The result of that outpouring wasn&#x2019;t just a novel; it was an extended letter to myself, written in those secret, lonely hours after the rest of the world went to bed. A letter reminding me to not lose touch with those I love, no matter where in the world we may be. Reminding me that it&#x2019;s okay to have fears; I&#x2019;m stronger for overcoming them. Reminding me to walk to the borders of who I am, and then to take a step beyond. </p> <p>I invite you to do the same.</p><b>Jessica Brockmole </b>spent several years living in Scotland, where she knew too well the challenges in maintaining relationships from a distance.

Proceeding sentence by sentence, city by city, and backwards in time, poet and essayist Kazim Ali details the struggle of coming of age between cultures, overcoming personal and family strictures to talk about private affairs and secrets long held. The text is comprised of sentences that alternate in time, ranging from discursive essay to memoir to prose poetry. Art, history, politics, geography, love, sexuality, writing, and religion, and the role silence plays in each, are its interwoven themes. Bright Felon is literally "autobiography" because the text itself becomes a form of writing the life, revealing secrets, and then, amid the shards and fragments of experience, dealing with the aftermath of such revelations. Bright Felon offers a new and active form of autobiography alongside such texts as Theresa Hak Kyung Cha's Dictee, Lyn Hejinian's My Life, and Etel Adnan's In the Heart of the Heart of Another Country. A reader's companion is available at http://brightfelonreader.site.wesleyan.edu/</p><p>KAZIM ALI is the author of two books of poetry, The Far Mosque (2004) and The Fortieth Day (2008). He is an assistant professor of creative writing at Oberlin College and teaches in the low-residency MFA program of the University of Southern Maine.

Part memoir, part trip book, part literary discourse, there is in it an urgent sense of a life lived in words. The tale is one of both innocence and experience.

Its impact on American society makes it one of the most influential developments in American religious history. </p><p>Christopher H. Evans traces the development of the social gospel in American Protestantism, and illustrates how the religious idealism of the movement also rose up within Judaism and Catholicism. </p><p>Contrary to the works of previous historians, Evans demonstrates how the presence of the social gospel continued in American culture long after its alleged demise following World War I. Evans reveals the many aspects of the social gospel and their influence on a range of social movements during the twentieth century, culminating with the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s. It also explores the relationship between the liberal social gospel of the early twentieth century and later iterations of social reform in late twentieth century evangelicalism. </p><p>The Social Gospel in American Religion considers an impressive array of historical figures including Washington Gladden, Emil Hirsch, Frances Willard, Reverdy Ransom, Walter Rauschenbusch, Stephen Wise, John Ryan, Harry Emerson Fosdick, A.J. Muste, Georgia Harkness, and Benjamin Mays. It demonstrates how these figures contributed to the shape of the social gospel in America, while arguing that the movement&#x2019;s legacy lies in its profound influence on broader traditions of liberal-progressive political reform in American history.</p></p><p><b>Christopher H. Evans </b>is<b> </b>Professor of History at Boston University and author of Histories of American Christianity: An Introduction and Liberalism without Illusions: Renewing an American Christian Tradition and editor of The Social Gospel Today, among other titles."Christopher Evans has broken the Social Gospel out of the theological and ecclesial boxes that have been used to contain and domesticate its message. In The Social Gospel in American Religion readers will appreciate the true scope of the Social Gospel witness for over the last century and recognize its prophetic relevance and urgent resonance for today's broken world in need of Good News." (Rev. Paul Raushenbush,Senior Vice-President for Public Engagement, Auburn Seminary)<br><br>"Christopher Evans has done it again. In this finely-crafted study one of the foremost scholars of the American Social Gospel weaves a story that is at once breathtaking in scope and full of subtle analysis. Anyone interested in the vital intersection of religion and reform in modern United States history will want to read this book." (Heath W. Carter,author of Union Made: Working People and the Rise of Social Christianity in Chicago)<br><br>"Evans provides a new and much needed history of one of Americas most important religious movements. With seeds planted during the Second Great Awakening, the fruits of the Social Gospel extend to the end of the 20th century, and, in ironic ways, even into our own time. Evans tells the story of a long Social Gospelfrom before the Civil War to after Civil Rights to Barack Obama. This book should become, in short order, the standard history of the Social Gospel." (Barry Hankins,Professor of History, Baylor University)<br><br>"Few subjects in American religious history invite interdisciplinary inquiries and readerships as much as does the Social Gospel. In the formal sense, it could be confined to a narrative of liberal American Protestantism c. 19001920. But, in the telling of Evans, its story begins a century earlier and, associated with new names, continues its reach into the present. Readers who have interests in the ethics of social reform, liberal theology and its opposition, African-American and feminist studies, rhetorical analyses of popular preaching, straight-out sociology, and the larger American historical contexts of movements and emphases like the Social Gospel will find reason to read this book with care." (Martin E. Marty <i>Journal of Interdisciplinary History</i>)<br><br>"In recounting the social gospels full story, Evans fights off caricatures of the movement from the neo-orthodox left and defends the social gospel against appropriations by the religious right. The end result is a well-written and insightful addition to the intellectual history of social Christianity in America." (Mark T. Edwards,Fides et Historia)<br><br>"Evans has made an important contribution both in his excellent explanation of the origins and nature of the social gospel and his strong case for seeing its influence extending well into the twentieth century. In doing so, Evans writes primarily about individual social gospel figures, many of them well-known, others not as prominent, including women and African American ministers or reformers. His brief discussions of these figures are the heart and the strength of the book."

In college we were told that men weren&#x2019;t necessary. Pop culture told us that career not family came first. The idea of being a stay-at-home mom was for losers. And yet are we happier than our mothers or grandmothers, who grew up before women were "liberated" by the sexual revolution? For many women, the answer is no. In The Politically Incorrect Guide&#x2122; to Women, Sex, and Feminism, Carrie Lukas, a young career woman and new mother, sets the record straight: correcting the lies women have been told and slamming the door on the screaming harpies of NOW, feminist professors, and the rest of the bra-burners who have done so much to wreck women&#x2019;s lives.<br> <br>Bet your feminist teacher never told you:<br> <br>* Women&#x2019;s lib has "liberated" men from having to commit, "freed" women from marriage, and often "unshackled" women from having a family. * More than ever, women in their twenties and thirties live alone, are discarded by boyfriends after "living together," and are watching their biological clocks tick past the point of no return. * Women still prefer men who are breadwinners and can protect them physically.</p><p>Carrie Lukas is the vice president for policy and economics at the Independent Women&#x2019;s Forum.

Buddhist monks and nuns have been intrigued by Benedict's insights into human nature and by the similarities between Christian and Buddhist traditions. Now, through personal anecdotes and thoughtful comparison, four prominent Buddhist scholars&#x2014;including Joseph Goldstein and Yifa&#x2014;reveal how the wisdom of each tradition can revitalize the other.&nbsp;<i>Benedict's Dharma</i>&nbsp;is a lively and compelling dialogue which will appeal not only to Buddhists and Christians, but to anyone interested in rediscovering the value of an ancient discipline in the modern world. Edited by Patrick Henry, with a new translation of the Rule of Saint Benedict by Patrick Barry, OSB.</p><p>When four senior Buddhists sit down to discuss the rules of Christian monasticism, ideas fly. In <i>Benedict's Dharma</i>, Zen priest Norman Fisher, meditation teacher Joseph Goldstein, professor Judith Simmer-Brown, and Yifa, a nun of the Chinese Buddhist tradition, flesh out <i>The Rule of Saint Benedict</i>, which has guided the organization and daily life of the Western Christian monastic tradition since the ninth century. Time after time, these Buddhists find in <i>The Rule of Saint Benedict</i>, which is included in its entirety, points that resonate with the their own experiences--points such as an emphasis on reverence, a pragmatic mindset, and the need for hard work and practice. From these agreements, as well as out of some marked differences, come lively evaluations of both Buddhist and Christian practices. And in the end, as the Christian monk David Steindl-Rast says in his "Afterword," the resources of the monastic tradition, for lay people as much as for monks, still have much to offer everyday life. Taking a Christian text as a source of inspiration for Buddhism offers a new rapprochement for those who have fled to Buddhism from a Christian upbringing. And for the Christian faithful, it offers a fresh perspective on a revered but musty classic. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Patrick Henry was a professor of religion, specializing in early Christianity, at Swarthmore College for seventeen years.

It traces today&#x2019;s often-disguised forms of rightwing extremism through the decades and across the globe to show how infiltration is a conscious and clandestine program for neofascist groups that seek to co-opt and undermine both mainstream and left-wing institutions in order to win elections, take political power, and create a new racist and authoritarian society.</p><p><p>&#x201c;A must-read book for all those looking for a comprehensive overview of the history and space of fascist ideologies and their current transformations.&#x201d; &#x2014;Marlene Laruelle, author of <em>Russian Eurasianism: An Ideology of Empire</em></p><br><p>&#x201c;Activists, journalists, and researchers who want to understand a surging far right, and how it borrows from the left, should start here.&#x201d; &#x2014;Jason Wilson, columnist, <em>The Guardian</em></p><br><p>&#x201c;This original and sweeping study is crucial reading for scholars and journalists trying to understand the complex and often contradictory relationships among populism, anti-elite demagoguery, scapegoating, conspiracism, and fascism.&#x201d; &#x2014;Chip Berlet, co-author of <em>Right-Wing Populism in America</em></p><br><p>&#x201c;Recent historiographical fashion has tended to portray fascism as a revolutionary form of authoritarian nationalist ideology.

The notion of &#x2018;the fascist creep&#x2019; helps us to understand how fascist ideals migrate from left to right and right to left and how they surreptitiously slip into the heart of the body politic.

Carefully dissecting its antecedents ... he uncovers how a variegated and often factious movement of rightist groups, activists, philosophers, and theoreticians evolved over the past several decades. His book cogently explains how these rightists synthesized seemingly contradictory political orientations, including fascism, socialism, authoritarianism, and libertarianism, to forge an amorphous ideology which animates a number of far right movements in America, Europe, and Russia. Although obscure, their influence persists in the incarnation of the &#x2018;Alt Right&#x2019; movement which has gained new vigor concomitant with the presidential campaign of Donald Trump. <em>Against the Fascist Creep</em> is a much-needed addition to the field of political extremism and will be enjoyed by both academics and the general public.&#x201d; &#x2014;George Michael, author of <em>Lone Wolf Terror and the Rise of Leaderless Resistance</em></p><br><p>&#x201c;Essential reading for those willing to remain awake to the ways fascist thinking and action continues to raise its ugly head.&#x201d; &#x2014;Joe Lowndes, author of <em>From the New Deal to the New Right: Race and Southern Origins of Modern Conservatism</em></p><br><p>&#x201c;This important book is essential reading for every social justice activist, a cautionary story of how any of us can be drawn to aspects of the rhetoric and social world of fascism without recognizing it as such.

I wish with all my heart that Naja Marie Aidt never had to write this book&#x2014;a memoir from the inside of grief&#x2014;and at the same time I am deeply grateful that she did. It is devastating, wise, precise, and beautiful. Sometimes a work of art makes you impatient: you want to share it with everyone.

[Her writing] about death, grief and the indescribable consequences make up this incredibly good book. I wish Aidt never had to write about this endless nightmare, indeed, one of its most important points is that grief never goes away.

Among his renowned portraits, &#34;The Daughters of Edward Darley Boit&#34; stands alongside &#34;Madame X&#34; and &#34;Lady Agnew of Lochnaw&#34; as one of Sargent&#39;s immortal images. This painting depicts four young sisters in the spacious foyer of the family&#39;s Paris apartment, strangely dispersed across the murky tones and depths of the square canvas, as though unrelated to one another, unsettled and unsettling to the eye. &#34;The Daughters&#34; both affirms and defies convention, flouting the boundaries between portrait and genre scene, formal composition and quick sketch or snapshot. Unveiled at the Paris Salon of 1883, it predated by just two years the scandal of &#34;Madame X&#34; and was itself characterized by one critic as &#34;four corners and a void&#34;; but Henry James came closer to the mark when he described the painter as a &#34;knock-down insolence of talent,&#34; for few of Sargent&#39;s works embody the epithet as well as &#34;The Daughters of Edward Darley Boit.&#34; Drawing on numerous unpublished archival documents, scholar Erica E. Hirshler excavates all facets of this iconic canvas, discussing not only its significance as a work of art but also the figures and events involved in its making, its importance for Sargent&#39;s career, its place in the tradition of artistic patronage and the myriad factors that have contributed to its lasting popularity and relevance. The result is an aesthetic, philosophical and personal tour de force that will change the way you look at Sargent&#39;s work, and that both illuminates an iconic painting and reaffirms its pungent magnetism.</p><p></p><h2>The Zen Teachings of Master Lin-Chi</h2><p>Among the most important texts of Zen literature, the <i>Lin-Chi lu</i> details the insights and exploits of the great ninth century Chinese Zen master Lin-chi, one of the most highly regarded of the T'ang period masters. PEN Translation Prize-winner Burton Watson presents here an eloquent translation -- the first in the English language -- of this seminal classic, <i>The Zen Teachings of Master Lin-chi</i>. The work is an exacting depiction of Lin-chi's words and actions, describing the Zen master's life and teaching, and includes a number of his sermons. Because Lin-chi's school outlasted other forms of early Chinese Zen to become dominant throughout China to this day, this translation bears unique significance within the literature of this great Asian nation. With Watson's lucid introduction to the work, a glossary of terms, and notes to the text, <i>The Zen Teachings of Master Lin-chi </i>is a generously constructed and accessible model of translation that will stand as the definitive primary material on Lin-chi for many years to come.</p><p>Renowned scholar Burton Watson&#39;s translation exactingly depicts the life and teachings of the great ninth-century Chinese Zen master Lin-chi, one of the most highly regarded of the T&#39;ang period masters.Burton Watson, the recipient of the 1981 PEN Translation Prize, has taught Chinese and Japanese literature at Columbia, Stanford, and Kyoto universities.

Many questions will be raised including: -- What role did extraterrestrials have in the lives of ancient civilizations? -- What ancient pyramids and towers tell us about the people who built them? Are they some sort of portals to another dimension? -- What prehistoric technologies have been discovered, and what can they tell us about early settlers, their religious beliefs, and possible other-worldy visitors? -- Did El Dorado exist, and what of the legendary Fountain of Youth? -- Was Atlantis in Cuba? -- What are America's lost races and what happened to them?</p><p><i>Discovering the Mysteries of Ancient America</i> brings to the fore the once-hidden true past of America's earliest civilizations.</p></p><p>Frank Joseph is the author of The Atlantis Encyclopedia (New Page Books), as well as a dozen other books on history, prehistory, and metaphysics.

Hurry up,&#x201d; Lori Reese urged, sounding more like a six-�year-�old than a young woman in her sophomore year of college. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t want to be late!&#x201d;<br><br>At the sound of her daughter&#x2019;s voice, Sarah Reese rolled over in bed, buried her face in the thick, downy pillow, and contemplated taking up bank robbery in order to afford a return trip to this resort. She and Lori were nearing the end of their two-�week all-�expenses-�paid Australian vacation, and the experience had given her a tantalizing taste of traveling in the lap of luxury.<br><br>&#x201c;Ten more minutes.&#x201d; This bed was heaven.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s already six-�fifteen.&#x201d;<br><br>Their ride to the marina was scheduled to arrive at seven o&#x2019;clock, and getting ready would take fifteen minutes, tops. She didn&#x2019;t need to hurry. &#x201c;Five more minutes.&#x201d;<br><br>Indulgent frustration laced Lori&#x2019;s voice. &#x201c;When exactly did we switch roles? I think it must have been the first day of the trip, when you spent half of that interminable plane ride flirting with the man across the aisle.&#x201d;<br><br>Sarah grinned into her pillow, then lazily rolled her head and looked at her daughter. Her heart melted with a potent combination of love and pride. Lori was a sophomore majoring in biomedical science at Texas A&amp;M University and making excellent progress toward her goal of earning admission to A&amp;M&#x2019;s College of Veterinary Medicine. She&#x2019;d worked hard to work ahead and cleared an extra ten days of spring break with her professors. At twenty, she was taller than her mother by seven inches&#x2014;�a fact she loved to tease five-�foot-�nothing Sarah about at every opportunity. She had Sarah&#x2019;s high cheekbones and dark hair, and her grandmother Ellen&#x2019;s sweet smile. Her eyes were a beautiful blend of shades of green. Sarah&#x2019;s late father had called them mountain eyes, because her eyes were a mountainside of aspen and fir and pi�on and cottonwood.<br><br>Sarah didn&#x2019;t see the mountains when she looked at Lori&#x2019;s eyes. She saw Cam Murphy. Her daughter had her father&#x2019;s eyes. She had Cam&#x2019;s height and Cam&#x2019;s eyes&#x2014;�two distinctive characteristics that provided Sarah an unwelcome reminder of the man she&#x2019;d just as soon forget.<br><br>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t flirting with the guy across the aisle. I was just being friendly. He was the one doing all the flirting.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, right.&#x201d; Lori&#x2019;s eyes gleamed with amusement as they made an exaggerated roll. &#x201c;Okay, here&#x2019;s the deal. I&#x2019;m going to wander over to the lobby and get two cups of coffee. If you&#x2019;re not out of bed by the time I come back, I&#x2019;ll drink both of them.&#x201d;<br><br>Sarah scowled and grumbled, &#x201c;Obviously I didn&#x2019;t spank you enough when you were little.&#x201d;<br><br>Lori laughed, and a moment later, Sarah heard the door to their suite softly close. She gave a wistful sigh, rolled onto her back, and sat up. Her reluctance to rise had more to do with the fact that today was the last day of their dream-�of-�a-�lifetime vacation than with fatigue.<br><br>They&#x2019;d had an absolutely, positively wonderful trip, seeing enough of the country to make them feel like they&#x2019;d gotten a taste of Australia but not so much that they felt rushed. The past three nights they&#x2019;d spent here at a magnificent resort on the Coral Sea, and today they&#x2019;d ice their vacation cake with a catamaran trip out to the Great Barrier Reef.<br><br>Sarah stretched as she gazed out through glass-�pane French doors, past the veranda, with its private spa tub, and across the golden-sand beach toward the turquoise sea. She crossed to the doors and pushed them open, then took time to count her blessings. This trip had been the grand prize in a contest sponsored by Angel&#x2019;s Rest, the healing center and spa owned by her friend Celeste Blessing in the little Rocky Mountain town where they lived. Back home in Eternity Springs, snow covered the ground, and the day they&#x2019;d left, the thermometer flirted with zero degrees. As the seaside breeze softly stirred, Sarah murmured, &#x201c;I still can&#x2019;t believe I&#x2019;m here.&#x201d;<br><br>She&#x2019;d dreamed of visiting Australia since childhood. Back in high school, she and Cam had stretched out on a quilt up at their favorite make-�out spot, Lover&#x2019;s Leap, and planned how they&#x2019;d backpack across Europe, explore the pyramids of Egypt, and dive the Great Barrier Reef. When life took a pair of unexpected turns their junior year, youthful dreams had faded in the face of stark, cold reality.<br><br>She wished one of those realities would hurry back with the coffee.<br><br>Sarah turned away from the breathtaking view and headed into the bathroom. When she emerged showered and dressed ten minutes later, she spied Lori seated outside on the veranda. Two cups of coffee and two huge cinnamon rolls waited on the small table between the chairs.<br><br>&#x201c;You are both wonderful and wicked, my child,&#x201d; Sarah told her daughter as she took her seat. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll gain two pounds just looking at that roll.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nah, we have a strenuous day ahead of us. We need the calories. Besides, you need to check out the competition. You might want to tweak your recipe for the cinnamon rolls you make for the Mocha Moose.&#x201d;<br><br>Sarah sipped her coffee and raised her brows in disdain. &#x201c;My cinnamon roll recipe doesn&#x2019;t need to be tweaked, thank you very much.&#x201d;<br><br>Lori tilted her head, considering, then said, &#x201c;Okay, you&#x2019;re right. It&#x2019;s impossible to improve on perfection.&#x201d;<br><br>Sarah operated Eternity Springs&#x2019;s only grocery store, the Trading Post, established by her great-�grandfather and run by family members ever since, but she supplemented her income by baking breads and desserts for a number of the businesses in town. She knew her way around a cake of yeast. She dipped her head in regal acceptance of her daughter&#x2019;s compliment, then tore off a piece of roll and popped it into her mouth. Sweet flavor exploded on her tongue. &#x201c;Yum, this is good. Could use a tiny bit more vanilla, though, I think.&#x201d;<br><br>The two women shared a grin, then polished off their breakfast. Moments later, tote bags stuffed with necessities of a day on the water in hand, they exited their suite. Seeing that the tour company van had yet to arrive, Sarah lamented, &#x201c;I could have had my ten minutes, after all.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, stop it. I&#x2019;m too excited to listen to you whine. Aren&#x2019;t you excited?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;m excited.&#x201d; Sarah threaded her arm through Lori&#x2019;s and squeezed. She was excited. The tour&#x2019;s itinerary sounded divine. First, the catamaran would sail to a cay famous for its protected sandy lagoon, gorgeous beach, and migratory bird population. Then while Sarah snorkeled&#x2014;�she&#x2019;d never learned to dive&#x2014;�Lori, who&#x2019;d earned her certification while away at college, would join other tour members in a drift dive along the reef. Following a gourmet lunch and some beach time, they&#x2019;d sail to the Outer Barrier Reef for more snorkeling for Sarah and a wall dive for Lori.<br><br>Diving the Great Barrier Reef. Wow. As a passenger van sporting the Adventures in Paradise Tours logo pulled into the resort&#x2019;s circular drive, Sarah couldn&#x2019;t help but think of Cam. She seldom allowed her mind to go there, but today, as their daughter was about to fulfill one of those Lover&#x2019;s Leap dreams, she couldn&#x2019;t hold back the memories.<br><br>Cameron Daniel Murphy. In so many ways, he&#x2019;d been born a troubled soul. His mother had been a Cava�naugh, the darling daughter of the town&#x2019;s leading family until she&#x2019;d rebelled against her parents by marrying the town scoundrel, Brian Murphy. They&#x2019;d disowned her, disinherited her, moved away from Eternity Springs, and died in a plane crash shortly before Cassie gave birth to Cam.<br><br>Cassie and Brian Murphy had struggled to make ends meet, and when Cassie showed up a time or two with bruises on her face, it set tongues wagging, but no one stepped in to help. Cassie died when Cam was eight years old, and Brian Murphy surrendered to alcoholism like his father had before him. It surprised no one. After all, he was a Murphy.<br><br>Cam had never stood a chance in Eternity Springs. For as long as Sarah could remember, Eternity Springs had waited with bated breath for the Murphy curse to show itself in Cam. They didn&#x2019;t have to wait very long. Cam first ran afoul of the law when he spray-�painted threats on the courthouse wall when he was nine, and for the next few years, he was in trouble more often than he was out of it.<br><br>But my, oh, my, he&#x2019;d done it for her&#x2014;�long before she even knew what &#x201c;it&#x201d; was. As a young man he&#x2019;d been as wild and beautiful as the cougars that prowled the surrounding forests. In the end, he&#x2019;d proved to be much more dangerous.<br><br>Their relationship had begun innocently enough when Cam had come to her rescue up on Murphy Mountain. On a Saturday in the spring of their freshman year, while on a camping trip with kids from church, a mix-�up in car assignments and an afternoon nap in the sunshine had left Sarah stranded. While she hiked down the mountain, Cam drove past on his motorcycle. When he stopped and offered to help, she hesitated. He was too young to have his driver&#x2019;s license, and she knew her parents would kill her if she rode with him&#x2014;�especially on a motor�cycle. But her feet hurt and the forbidden thrill beckoned. They&#x2019;d taken the long way home.<br><br>Cam Murphy had charmed her that afternoon, and the relationship that developed between the two teenagers over the next year had remained a secret pleasure. To this day, most people in Eternity Springs believed the lie about Lori&#x2019;s paternity that she&#x2019;d told to protect her precious child&#x2019;s shoulders from bearing the weight of &#x201c;Murphy bad blood.&#x201d;<br><br>Yet Sarah had loved Cam Murphy with every fiber of her foolish, teenaged soul. She&#x2019;d had to grow up in order to put her love for him behind her. His rejection and the reality of a dependent child had made it easier to accomplish.<br><br>The van braked to a stop in front of them, shaking Sarah from her reverie. The driver&#x2019;s door opened, and a young man with sun-�streaked hair, suntanned skin, and a bruised and swollen black eye exited the shuttle with a spring in his step. &#x201c;G&#x2019;day, ladies,&#x201d; he said in that wonderful Aussie drawl. &#x201c;Reese, party of two, for Adventures in Paradise Tours?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s us,&#x201d; Lori confirmed. Her eyes widened and she winced when she got a good look at his injury. &#x201c;Wow. I bet that hurts.&#x201d;<br><br>The boy flashed a grin. &#x201c;Not much. I&#x2019;ve had worse. M&#x2019;name&#x2019;s Devin, and I&#x2019;m your transportation to the marina and the Bliss.

Or are we just going to sit here all night?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Patience, Finn,&#x201d; I murmured. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been in the car for only an hour.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Longest hour of my life,&#x201d; he muttered.<br> <br>I arched an eyebrow and looked over at Finnegan Lane, my partner in crime for the night. Most nights, actually. Just after ten o&#x2019;clock a few days before Christmas, and we sat in the darkened front of Finn&#x2019;s black Cadillac Escalade. An hour ago, Finn had parked the car in a secluded, out-of-the-way alley overlooking the docks that fronted the Aneirin River. We&#x2019;d been sitting here, and Finn had been grousing ever since.<br> <br>Finn shifted in his seat, and my gray eyes flicked over him. The wool fabric of his thick coat outlined his broad shoulders, while a black watchman&#x2019;s cap covered his walnut-colored hair. His eyes were a bright green even in the semidarkness, and the shadows did little to hide the square handsomeness of his face.<br> <br>Most women would be glad to be in such close quarters with Finnegan Lane. With his easy smile and natural charm, Finn would have already had the majority of them in the backseat, pants off, legs up, steam covering the windows as the car rocked back and forth.<br> <br>Good thing I wasn&#x2019;t most women.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, Gin,&#x201d; Finn whined again. &#x201c;Go stick a couple of your knives in that guy and leave your rune for Mab to find so we can get out of here.&#x201d;<br> <br>I stared out the car window. Across the street, bathed in the golden glow of a streetlight, the guy in question continued to unload wooden crates from the small tugboat that he&#x2019;d pulled up to the dock forty-five minutes ago. Even from this distance, I could hear the warped, weathered boards creak under his weight as the river rushed on by beneath them.<br> <br>The man was a dwarf&#x2014;short, squat, stocky, sturdy&#x2014;and dressed in black clothes practically identical to the ones that Finn and I were wearing. Jeans, boots, sweater, jacket. The sorts of anonymous clothes you wore to go skulking about late at night, especially in this rough Southtown neighborhood, and most especially when you didn&#x2019;t want anyone else to see what you were up to.<br> <br>Or when you were planning on killing someone, like I was tonight. Most nights, actually.<br> <br>I rubbed my thumb over the hilt of the silverstone knife that I held in my lap. The metal glinted dully in the darkness of the car, and the weight of the weapon felt cold and comforting to me. The knife rested lightly on the spider rune scar embedded in my palm.<br> <br>It would be easy enough to give in to Finn&#x2019;s whining. To slip out of the car, cross the street, creep up behind the dwarf, cut his throat, and shove his body off the dock and into the cold river below. I probably wouldn&#x2019;t even get that much blood on my clothes, if I got the angles just right.<br> <br>Because that&#x2019;s what assassins did. That&#x2019;s what I did. Me. Gin Blanco. The assassin known as the Spider, one of the best around.<br> <br>But I didn&#x2019;t get out of the car and get on with things like Finn wanted me to. Instead, I sighed. &#x201c;He hardly seems worth the trouble. He&#x2019;s a flunkie, just like all the others that I&#x2019;ve killed these past two weeks. Mab will hire someone else to take his place before they even dredge his body out of the river.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, you were the one who decided to declare war on Mab Monroe,&#x201d; Finn pointed out. &#x201c;Correct me if I&#x2019;m wrong, but I believe that you were rather eager to kill your way up to the top of the food chain until you got to her. You said it would be fun.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That was six hits ago. Now I&#x2019;d just like to kill Mab and give everyone in Ashland an early Christmas present, myself included.&#x201d; My turn to grouse.<br> <br>But Finn was right. A few weeks ago, a series of events had led me to officially declare war on Mab, and now I was dealing with the fallout&#x2014;and the tedious boredom of it all.<br> <br>Mab Monroe was the Fire elemental who ran the southern metropolis of Ashland like it was her own personal kingdom. To most folks, Mab was a paragon of virtue who used her magic, business connections, and money to fund worthwhile charity projects throughout the city. But those of us who strolled through the shady side of life knew Mab for what she really was&#x2014;the head of a moblike empire that included everything from gambling and drugs to prostitution and kidnappings. Murder, extortion, torture, blackmail, beatings. Mab ordered all that and more, practically on a daily basis. But the Fire elemental was so wealthy, so powerful, so strong in her magic that no one dared to stand up to her.<br> <br>Until me.<br> <br>I had a special reason to hate Mab&#x2014;she&#x2019;d murdered my mother and older sister when I was thirteen. And she&#x2019;d been planning on doing the same thing to me and my baby sister, Bria. But first, Mab had captured and tortured me that fateful night so long ago. Which is how I&#x2019;d ended up with a pair of matching scars on my hands.<br> <br>I put my knife down long enough to rub first one scar, then the other with my fingers. A small circle surrounded by eight thin rays was branded into each of my palms. A spider rune. The symbol for patience. My assassin name.<br> <br>And one that Mab Monroe was now seeing everywhere she went.<br> <br>For the past two weeks, I&#x2019;d been stalking Mab&#x2019;s men, getting a feel for her operation, seeing exactly what kinds of illegal pies she had her sticky fingers in. And along the way, I&#x2019;d picked off some of her minions when I caught them doing things that they shouldn&#x2019;t, hurting people that they shouldn&#x2019;t. A twist of my knife, a slash of my blade, and Mab had one less soldier in her little army of terror.<br> <br>Killing her men hadn&#x2019;t been hard, not for me. I&#x2019;d spent the last seventeen years of my life being an assassin, being the Spider, until I&#x2019;d retired a few months ago. Certain skills you just never forgot.<br> <br>Normally, though, when I killed someone I left nothing behind. No fingerprints, no weapon, no DNA. But with Mab&#x2019;s men, I&#x2019;d purposefully drawn the image of my spider rune at every scene, close to every body I left behind. Taunting her. Letting Mab know exactly who was responsible for messing up her plans and that I was determined to pick her empire apart one body at a time, if I had to.<br> <br>Which is why Finn and I were now sitting in the dark down by the docks in this dangerous Southtown neighborhood. Finn had gotten a tip from one of his sources that Mab had a shipment of drugs or some other illegal paraphernalia coming into Ashland tonight. As the Spider, I&#x2019;d decided to come down here and see what I could do to foul up Mab&#x2019;s plans once more, thumb my nose at her, and generally piss her off.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, Gin,&#x201d; Finn cut into my musings. &#x201c;Make a move already. The guy&#x2019;s alone. We would have seen his partner by now, if he&#x2019;d had one.&#x201d;<br> <br>I looked at the dwarf. He&#x2019;d finished unloading the boxes from the tugboat and was now busy hauling them over to a van parked at the end of the dock.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But something about this just doesn&#x2019;t seem right.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Finn muttered. &#x201c;The fact that I can&#x2019;t feel my feet anymore and you won&#x2019;t let me turn on the heater.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Drink your coffee, then. It&#x2019;ll make you feel better. It always does.&#x201d;<br> <br>For the first time tonight, a grin spread across Finn&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;Why, I think that&#x2019;s an excellent idea.&#x201d;<br> <br>Finn reached down and grabbed a large metal thermos from the floorboard in the backseat. He cracked open the top, and the caffeine fumes of his chicory coffee filled the car. The rich smell always reminded me of his father, Fletcher Lane, my mentor, the one who&#x2019;d taught me everything I knew about being an assassin. The old man had drunk the same foul brew as his son before he&#x2019;d died earlier this year. I smiled at the memory and the warmth it stirred in me.<br> <br>While Finn drank his coffee, I stared out at the scene before me once more. Everything seemed still, quiet, cold, dark. But I couldn&#x2019;t shake the feeling that something was wrong. That something was just slightly off about this whole setup. Fletcher had always told me that nobody ever got dead by waiting just a few more minutes. His advice had kept me alive this long, and I had no intention of disregarding it now.<br> <br>Once again my eyes scanned the area. Deserted street. A few dilapidated buildings hugging the waterfront. The black ribbon of the Aneirin River in the distance. The pale boards of the dock. A lone light flickering over the dwarf&#x2019;s head.<br> <br>My eyes narrowed, and I focused on the light. The bright, intact light burning like a beacon in the dark night. Then I looked up and down the street, my gaze flicking from one iron post to the next. Every other light on the block was busted out. Not surprising. This was Southtown, after all, the part of Ashland that was home to gangbangers, vampire prostitutes, and junkie elementals strung out on their own magic and hungry for more. People would just as soon kill you as look at you here. Not a place you wanted to linger, even during the daylight hours.<br> <br>So I wasn&#x2019;t surprised that the streetlights had been broken, probably long ago, by the rocks, beer bottles, and other trash that littered the street. What did surprise me was the fact that there was one still burning&#x2014;the one right over the van that the dwarf was packing his boxes into.<br> <br>How ... convenient.<br> <br>&#x201c;You might as well get comfortable,&#x201d; I said, staring at the lone light. &#x201c;Because we&#x2019;re going to be here a while longer.&#x201d;<br> <br>Finn just groaned.<br> <br>We didn&#x2019;t have long to wait. Ten minutes later, the dwarf finished loading the last of his boxes into the van. Once I started watching him&#x2014;really watching him&#x2014;I realized that he&#x2019;d been taking his sweet time about things. Moving slower than a normal person would have, especially considering the bitter cold that frosted Ashland tonight. But then again, this was far from the innocent scene that it appeared to be.<br> <br>Now the dwarf stood beside the van, smoking a cigarette and staring into the darkness with watchful eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s he doing?&#x201d; Finn asked, taking another sip of coffee. &#x201c;If the man had any sense, he&#x2019;d crank up the heater in that van and get out of here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just wait,&#x201d; I murmured. &#x201c;Just wait.&#x201d;<br> <br>Finn sighed and drank some more of his chicory brew.<br> <br>Five more minutes passed before a flash of movement along the dock caught my eye.<br> <br>&#x201c;There,&#x201d; I said and leaned forward. &#x201c;Right fucking there.&#x201d;<br> <br>A figure stepped out from behind a small shack squatting at the far end of the dock that jutted out into the river.<br> <br>Finn jerked upright and almost spilled his coffee on the leather seats. &#x201c;Where the hell did he come from?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not he,&#x201d; I murmured. &#x201c;She.&#x201d;<br> <br>The woman strolled down the dock toward the dwarf. Despite the darkness, the single streetlight still burning let me get a good look at her. She was petite and slender, about my age, thirty or so. She had a short bob of glossy black hair, held back with a headband, and her features had an Asian flavor to them&#x2014;porcelain skin, expressive eyes, delicate cheekbones. She also wore black from head to toe, just like the rest of us.<br> <br>I frowned. No woman in her right mind would walk through this neighborhood alone at night. Hell, not many would dare to do it during the day. Much less wait more than an hour in a run-down shack on a December night when the temperature hovered in the low twenties.<br> <br>Unless she had a very, very good reason for being there.<br> <br>And I was beginning to think I knew exactly what that reason was&#x2014;me.<br> <br>The woman reached the dwarf, who crushed out his cigarette. She said something to the man, who just shrugged his shoulders. The woman turned and scanned the street, much the same way that I&#x2019;d been doing for the last hour. But I knew she couldn&#x2019;t see us, given where we were parked. The Dumpster sitting at the end of the narrow alley in front of Finn&#x2019;s vehicle screened us from her line of sight.<br> <br>After another thirty seconds of looking, the woman turned back to the dwarf and advanced on him. For a moment he looked confused. Then startled. Then his eyes widened, and he turned and started running away from her.<br> <br>He got maybe five steps before the woman lifted her right hand&#x2014;and green lightning shot out of her fingertips.<br> <br>Finn jerked, almost spilling his coffee again. Even I blinked at the sudden, powerful flash of light.<br> <br>The dwarf arched his back and screamed, his harsh cry echoing down the deserted street, as the lightning slammed into his body. The woman advanced on him, the magical light in her hand intensifying as she stepped closer.<br> <br>And she was so fucking strong. She stood at least a hundred feet away from me, but I could still sense the sharp, static crackle of her power even here in the car. The feel of her elemental magic made the spider rune scars on my palms itch and burn the way they always did whenever I was exposed to so much power, to so much raw magic. And she had plenty to spare.<br> <br>A second later, the dwarf caught fire. He wobbled back and forth before pitching to the cracked pavement, but the woman didn&#x2019;t stop her magical assault. She stood over his body, sending wave after wave of lightning into his figure, even as the green elemental flames of her power consumed his skin, hair, and clothes.<br> <br>When she was done, the woman curled her hand into a tight fist. The bright lightning flickered, then sparked away into nothingness, like a flare that had been snuffed out. Greenish gray smoke wafted up from her fingertips, and she blew it away into the frosty night air, like an Old West gunfighter cooling down his Colt after a shootout. How dramatic.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you see that?&#x201d; Finn whispered, his coffee forgotten, his green eyes wide and round in his face. &#x201c;She electrocuted him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah. I saw.&#x201d;<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t add that she&#x2019;d used elemental magic to do it. Finn had seen that for himself.<br> <br>Elementals were people who could create, control, and manipulate one of the four elements&#x2014;Air, Fire, Ice, and Stone. Those were the areas that most folks were gifted in, the ones you had to be able to tap into to be considered a true elemental. But magic had many forms, many quirks, and some people could use other areas, offshoots of one of the four elements. Metal was an offshoot of Stone, and electricity was one of Air.<br> <br>One that Finn and I had just seen used to deadly efficiency, thanks to our mystery woman.<br> <br>I was an elemental too. In my case, I had the rare ability of being able to control two elements&#x2014;Ice and Stone. But I&#x2019;d never seen someone with electrical power before. And I wasn&#x2019;t so sure it was a good thing that I had now.<br> <br>The woman stuck the toe of her boot into the man&#x2019;s ribs. A large hunk of his body disintegrated into gray ash at her touch and puffed up like some kind of cold, macabre fog. A sliver of a smile lifted her lips at the sight. Then she reached inside her coat, drew out something white, and tossed it down on top of his body before heading toward the van and sliding inside.<br> <br>Thirty seconds later, the woman drove the van down the street, turned the corner, and disappeared from view. But instead of watching the vehicle, I stared at the burned-out body that she&#x2019;d left behind, wondering what that bit of white was on the dwarf&#x2019;s still-smoking chest.<br> <br>&#x201c;You want me to follow her?&#x201d; Finn asked, his hand hovering over the keys in the ignition.<br> <br>I shook my head. &#x201c;No. Stay here and keep an eye out...</p><h2>Harry Potter &amp; The Prisoner Of Azkaban</h2><p>Award-winning artist Jim Kay illustrates year three of Harry Potter&#39;s adventures at Hogwarts in a stunning, gift-worthy collector&#39;s edition.

(Little Spot Board Bks.). Putnam. Oct. 1986. BD $3.50. PreS Spot is the star of a series of new board books which are colorful, imaginative, and delightfully simple. In each book, a word or concept is presented with a bold illustration and then used in a sentence accompanied by another bright picture. As in Hill's other books, sometimes Spot engages in dog-like activities such as fetching a shoe or playing with a toy; at other times he is more like a child, reading a book and sitting in a chair. The discrepancy doesn't intrude though, since Spot looks a bit like Snoopy, who also flip-flops back and forth between dog and child-like personae.

This collection of modern-day interpretations brings together the wisdom, sensitivity, and spirituality of the biblical story with the struggles and insights of contemporary women. Readers will be moved and inspired by these essays."<br>--Susannah Heschel<br> Editor of On Being a Jewish Feminist<br>With Reading Ruth, two creative scholars have brought together an amazingly eclectic group of Jewish novelists, essayists, poets, rabbis, psychologists, and scholars--including Cynthia Ozick, Marge Piercy, Francine Klagsbrun, and Nessa Rapoport--to explore one of the most beloved stories in the Bible. In lively essays, poetry, fiction, and personal narrative, the gamut of women's experience in the modern world is illuminated by this ancient story. Whether the essayists explore relationships between sisters, the complex bond between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, the place of the "other" in society, the heartache of loss, the limitations of loyalty, or the elaborate connections of family, they give voice to an exciting array of thought and interpretation that endows this sacred tale with new life.<br>"[A] rich, diverse, and thought-provoking collection."<br>--Judith Plaskow<br> Author of Standing Again at Sinai<br><br>"Filled with passion, humor, insight, and just the right combination of irreverence and awe, Reading Ruth puts the Book of Ruth right where it belongs--in the hands of women. All of us are the richer for it."<br>--Ari L. Goldman<br> Author of The Search for God at Harvard<br>"The book of Ruth is a gem in its own right. Through Reading Ruth the gem becomes a multifaceted diamond that reflects and refracts a multiplicity of images....Read this book."<br>--The Rocky Mountain News</p><p>Traditionally the Book of Ruth is read during the Jewish holiday, Shavuot -- a holiday that celebrates the giving of the Torah (Old Testament) to the Jewish people. It is also a tradition during this holiday to spend the night studying the Old Testament (some people even stay up all night!). The year that I worked on the publicity for Reading Ruth, my sister and I decided to have our own study session during Shavuot and we read parts of this book together. We had a wonderful time reading the poems by Marge Piercy, Ruth Whitman, and Merle Feld and discussing the themes of the Book of Ruth -- including loss, the relationship between sisters, and the bond between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. In addition to poetry, Reading Ruth includes essays, fiction, and personal narrative by famous Jewish women who are novelists, poets, rabbis, psychologists, and scholars. If you enjoy women studies and/or Bible studies you will enjoy Reading Ruth -- any time of the year!In Reading Ruth, thirty contemporary Jewish novelists, essayists, poets, rabbis, psychologists, and scholars - including Cynthia Ozick, Marge Piercy, Francine Klagsbrun, and Nessa Rapoport - explore this biblical work and reclaim it for women on their own terms. In lively essays, poetry, fiction, and personal narrative, a breathtaking gamut of women&#39;s experience in the modern world has been brought to bear to illuminate women&#39;s connection to the ancient sources. Whether they explore the relationships between sisters, the complex bond between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, the place of the &#34;other&#34; in society, the heartache of loss, the limitations of loyalty, or the elaborate connections of family, these extraordinary intellects give voice to the exciting array of thought and interpretation that endows this sacred tale with new life. For Jewish women and all readers who want to probe the deeper levels of an ancient text, and feminists who crave a connection to our spiritual foremothers, Reading Ruth is a fascinating exploration - representing an exciting, innovative, and dynamic encounter between women and the Bible.</p><h2>Conservatives Without Conscience</h2><p><b>On the heels of his national bestseller <i>Worse Than Watergate</i>, John Dean takes a critical look at the current conservative movement</b> <br><br> In <i>Conservatives Without Conscience</i>, John Dean places the conservative movement's inner circle of leaders in the Republican Party under scrutiny. Dean finds their policies and mind- set to be fundamentally authoritarian, and as such, a danger to democracy. By examining the legacies of such old-line conservatives as J. Edgar Hoover, Spiro Agnew, and Phyllis Schlafly and of such current figures as Dick Cheney, Newt Gingrich, and leaders of the Religious Right, Dean presents an alarming record of abuses of power. His trenchant analysis of how conservatism has lost its bearings serves as a chilling warning and a stirring inspiration to safeguard constitutional principles.</p><p>In <i>Conservatives Without Conscience</i>, John Dean, who served as White House counsel under Richard Nixon and then helped to break the Watergate scandal with his testimony before the Senate, takes a vivid and analytical look at a Republican Party that has changed drastically from the conservative movement that he joined in the mid-1960s as an admirer of Senator Barry Goldwater. Listen to our interview with Dean as part of our July 13 Amazon Wire podcast (along with interviews with Garrison Keillor and Henry Rollins) to hear how he originally conceived of the book with the late Senator Goldwater, and the social science research he drew on to put together his portrait of the "conservative authoritarian."

Following the breakdown of relations between Russia and France, Napoleon assembled a vast Grande Arm�e drawn from the many states within the French sphere of influence. They crossed the river Neimen and entered Russian territory in June 1812 with the aim of inflicting a sharp defeat on the Tsar&#39;s forces and bringing the Russians back into line. In a bloody battle of head-on attacks and desperate counter-attacks in the village of Borodino on 7 September 1812, both sides lost about a third of their men, with the Russians forced to withdraw and abandon Moscow to the French. However, the Grande Arm�e was harassed by Russian troops all the way back and was destroyed by the retreat. The greatest army Napoleon had ever commanded was reduced to a shadow of frozen, starving fugitives. This title will cover the events of Napoleon&#39;s disastrous Russian campaign of 1812 in its entirety, with the set-piece battle of Borodino proving the focal point of the book.</p><p>Philip Haythornthwaite is an internationally respected author and historical consultant specializing in the military history, uniforms and equipment of the 18th and 19th centuries.

Cox, The Midwest Book Review</i></p></p><h2>Glimpses of World History</h2><p>Glimpses of World History, a book written by Jawaharlal Nehru in 1934, is a panoramic sweep of the history of humankind. It is a collection of 196 letters written between 1930-1933, as an introduction to the world history to his daughter Indira, then thirteen years old. The letters, written in a span of thirty months when Nehru was imprisoned in various places by the British, starts off with one he sends to his daughter on her birthday. He says he is sad about not being able to send her any &#34;material&#34; gift from prison, so he would try to give her something he can &#34;afford&#34;, a series of letters from his heart. Written from prison, where he had no recourse to reference books or a library but his personal notes, Glimpses of World History contains the history of humankind from 6000 BC to the time of writing of the book. It covers the rise and fall of great empires and civilizations from Greece and Rome to China and West Asia; great figures such as Ashoka and Genghis Khan, Gandhi and Lenin; wars and revolutions, democracies and dictatorships. He wrote about many cultures throughout the globe in detail because, as he himself said, he didn&#39;t like the way history was taught in schools where it was confined to the history of a single country and that too narrow, and he wanted his daughter Priyadarshini to know why people did what they did. It was possible only through knowing the history of the whole world. The letters are written in informal language, with the contemporary and personal events too are mentioned. They reflect the world view of Nehru, and his grasp of history. It could be considered as one of the first attempts at historiography from a non-Eurocentric angle. The book is comparable to The Outline of History by H. G. Wells. The New York Times described it as . . . one of the most remarkable books ever written . . . Nehru makes even H.G.Wells seem singularly insular . . . One is awed by the breadth of Nehru&#39;s culture.([1])</p><p></p><h2>God in Pain: Inversions of Apocalypse</h2><p>A brilliant dissection and reconstruction of the three major faith-based systems of belief in the world today, from one of the world's most articulate intellectuals, Slavoj Zizek, in conversation with Croatian philosopher Boris Gunjevic.

Joan Didion</h2><p>This happened on December 30, 2003. That may seem a while ago but it won&#39;t when it happens to youIn this adaptation of her award-winning, bestselling memoir, Joan Didion transforms the story of the sudden and unexpected loss of her husband and their only daughter into a stunning and powerful one-woman play.The first production of The Year of Magical Thinking, starring Vanessa Redgrave and directed by David Hare, was a runaway hit on Broadway in 2007. The same production is transferring to the National Theatre from April to July 2008.</p><p>Joan Didion was born in California and lives in New York. She is the author of five novels and seven previous books of nonfiction: among them the great portraits of a decade in essays, `Sentimental Journeys&#39;, `The White Album&#39;, and `Slouching Towards Bethlehem&#39;.Chapter 1 <br><br>1.<br><br><i>Life changes fast.</i><br><br><i>Life changes in the instant.</i><br><br><i>You sit down to dinner and life as you know it ends.</i><br><br><i>The question of self-pity.</i><br><br>Those were the first words I wrote after it happened. The computer dating on the Microsoft Word file (&#x201c;Notes on change.doc&#x201d;) reads &#x201c;May 20, 2004, 11:11 p.m.,&#x201d; but that would have been a case of my opening the file and reflexively pressing save when I closed it. I had made no changes to that file in May. I had made no changes to that file since I wrote the words, in January 2004, a day or two or three after the fact.<br><br>For a long time I wrote nothing else.<br><br><i>Life changes in the instant.</i><br><br><i>The ordinary instant.</i><br><br>At some point, in the interest of remembering what seemed most striking about what had happened, I considered adding those words, &#x201c;the ordinary instant.&#x201d; I saw immediately that there would be no need to add the word &#x201c;ordinary,&#x201d; because there would be no forgetting it: the word never left my mind. It was in fact the ordinary nature of everything preceding the event that prevented me from truly believing it had happened, absorbing it, incorporating it, getting past it. I recognize now that there was nothing unusual in this: confronted with sudden disaster we all focus on how unremarkable the circumstances were in which the unthinkable occurred, the clear blue sky from which the plane fell, the routine errand that ended on the shoulder with the car in flames, the swings where the children were playing as usual when the rattlesnake struck from the ivy. &#x201c;He was on his way home from work&#x2014;happy, successful, healthy&#x2014;and then, gone,&#x201d; I read in the account of a psychiatric nurse whose husband was killed in a highway accident. In 1966 I happened to interview many people who had been living in Honolulu on the morning of December 7, 1941; without exception, these people began their accounts of Pearl Harbor by telling me what an &#x201c;ordinary Sunday morning&#x201d; it had been. &#x201c;It was just an ordinary beautiful September day,&#x201d; people still say when asked to describe the morning in New York when American Airlines 11 and United Airlines 175 got flown into the World Trade towers. Even the report of the 9/11 Commission opened on this insistently premonitory and yet still dumbstruck narrative note: &#x201c;Tuesday, September 11, 2001, dawned temperate and nearly cloudless in the eastern United States.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And then&#x2014;gone.&#x201d; <i>In the midst of life we are in death</i>, Episcopalians say at the graveside. Later I realized that I must have repeated the details of what happened to everyone who came to the house in those first weeks, all those friends and relatives who brought food and made drinks and laid out plates on the dining room table for however many people were around at lunch or dinner time, all those who picked up the plates and froze the leftovers and ran the dishwasher and filled our (I could not yet think <i>my</i>) otherwise empty house even after I had gone into the bedroom (our bedroom, the one in which there still lay on a sofa a faded terrycloth XL robe bought in the 1970s at Richard Carroll in Beverly Hills) and shut the door. Those moments when I was abruptly overtaken by exhaustion are what I remember most clearly about the first days and weeks. I have no memory of telling anyone the details, but I must have done so, because everyone seemed to know them. At one point I considered the possibility that they had picked up the details of the story from one another, but immediately rejected it: the story they had was in each instance too accurate to have been passed from hand to hand. It had come from me.<br><br>Another reason I knew that the story had come from me was that no version I heard included the details I could not yet face, for example the blood on the living room floor that stayed there until Jos� came in the next morning and cleaned it up.<br><br>Jos�. Who was part of our household. Who was supposed to be flying to Las Vegas later that day, December 31, but never went. Jos� was crying that morning as he cleaned up the blood. When I first told him what had happened he had not understood. Clearly I was not the ideal teller of this story, something about my version had been at once too offhand and too elliptical, something in my tone had failed to convey the central fact in the situation (I would encounter the same failure later when I had to tell Quintana), but by the time Jos� saw the blood he understood.<br><br>I had picked up the abandoned syringes and ECG electrodes before he came in that morning but I could not face the blood.<br><br>In outline.<br><br>It is now, as I begin to write this, the afternoon of October 4, 2004.<br><br>Nine months and five days ago, at approximately nine o&#x2019;clock on the evening of December 30, 2003, my husband, John Gregory Dunne, appeared to (or did) experience, at the table where he and I had just sat down to dinner in the living room of our apartment in New York, a sudden massive coronary event that caused his death. Our only child, Quintana, had been for the previous five nights unconscious in an intensive care unit at Beth Israel Medical Center&#x2019;s Singer Division, at that time a hospital on East End Avenue (it closed in August 2004) more commonly known as &#x201c;Beth Israel North&#x201d; or &#x201c;the old Doctors&#x2019; Hospital,&#x201d; where what had seemed a case of December flu sufficiently severe to take her to an emergency room on Christmas morning had exploded into pneumonia and septic shock. This is my attempt to make sense of the period that followed, weeks and then months that cut loose any fixed idea I had ever had about death, about illness, about probability and luck, about good fortune and bad, about marriage and children and memory, about grief, about the ways in which people do and do not deal with the fact that life ends, about the shallowness of sanity, about life itself. I have been a writer my entire life. As a writer, even as a child, long before what I wrote began to be published, I developed a sense that meaning itself was resident in the rhythms of words and sentences and paragraphs, a technique for withholding whatever it was I thought or believed behind an increasingly impenetrable polish. The way I write is who I am, or have become, yet this is a case in which I wish I had instead of words and their rhythms a cutting room, equipped with an Avid, a digital editing system on which I could touch a key and collapse the sequence of time, show you simultaneously all the frames of memory that come to me now, let you pick the takes, the marginally different expressions, the variant readings of the same lines. This is a case in which I need more than words to find the meaning. This is a case in which I need whatever it is I think or believe to be penetrable, if only for myself.<br>2.<br><br>December 30, 2003, a Tuesday.<br><br>We had seen Quintana in the sixth-floor ICU at Beth Israel North.<br><br>We had come home.<br><br>We had discussed whether to go out for dinner or eat in.<br><br>I said I would build a fire, we could eat in.<br><br>I built the fire, I started dinner, I asked John if he wanted a drink.<br><br>I got him a Scotch and gave it to him in the living room, where he was reading in the chair by the fire where he habitually sat.<br><br>The book he was reading was by David Fromkin, a bound galley of <i>Europe&#x2019;s Last Summer: Who Started the Great War in 1914?</i><br><br>I finished getting dinner, I set the table in the living room where, when we were home alone, we could eat within sight of the fire. I find myself stressing the fire because fires were important to us. I grew up in California, John and I lived there together for twenty-four years, in California we heated our houses by building fires. We built fires even on summer evenings, because the fog came in. Fires said we were home, we had drawn the circle, we were safe through the night. I lit the candles. John asked for a second drink before sitting down. I gave it to him. We sat down. My attention was on mixing the salad.<br><br>John was talking, then he wasn&#x2019;t.<br><br>At one point in the seconds or minute before he stopped talking he had asked me if I had used single-malt Scotch for his second drink. I had said no, I used the same Scotch I had used for his first drink. &#x201c;Good,&#x201d; he had said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know why but I don&#x2019;t think you should mix them.&#x201d; At another point in those seconds or that minute he had been talking about why World War One was the critical event from which the entire rest of the twentieth century flowed.<br><br>I have no idea which subject we were on, the Scotch or World War One, at the instant he stopped talking.<br><br>I only remember looking up. His left hand was raised and he was slumped motionless. At first I thought he was making a failed joke, an attempt to make the difficulty of the day seem manageable.<br><br>I remember saying <i>Don&#x2019;t do that</i>.<br><br>When he did not respond my first thought was that he had started to eat and choked. I remember trying to lift him far enough from the back of the chair to give him the Heimlich. I remember the sense of his weight as he fell forward, first against the table, then to the floor. In the kitchen by the telephone I had taped a card with the New York&#x2013;Presbyterian ambulance numbers. I had not taped the numbers by the telephone because I anticipated a moment like this. I had taped the numbers by the telephone in case someone in the building needed an ambulance.<br><br>Someone else.<br><br>I called one of the numbers. A dispatcher asked if he was breathing. I said <i>Just come</i>. When the paramedics came I tried to tell them what had happened but before I could finish they had transformed the part of the living room where John lay into an emergency department. One of them (there were three, maybe four, even an hour later I could not have said) was talking to the hospital about the electrocardiogram they seemed already to be transmitting. Another was opening the first or second of what would be many syringes for injection. (Epinephrine? Lidocaine? Procainamide? The names came to mind but I had no idea from where.) I remember saying that he might have choked. This was dismissed with a finger swipe: the airway was clear. They seemed now to be using defibrillating paddles, an attempt to restore a rhythm. They got something that could have been a normal heartbeat (or I thought they did, we had all been silent, there was a sharp jump), then lost it, and started again.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s still fibbing,&#x201d; I remember the one on the telephone saying.<br><br>&#x201c;<i>V</i>-fibbing,&#x201d; John&#x2019;s cardiologist said the next morning when he called from Nantucket. &#x201c;They would have said &#x2018;<i>V</i>-fibbing.&#x2019; V for ventricular.&#x201d;<br><br>Maybe they said &#x201c;V-fibbing&#x201d; and maybe they did not. Atrial fibrillation did not immediately or necessarily cause cardiac arrest. Ventricular did. Maybe ventricular was the given.<br><br>I remember trying to straighten out in my mind what would happen next. Since there was an ambulance crew in the living room, the next logical step would be going to the hospital. It occurred to me that the crew could decide very suddenly to go to the hospital and I would not be ready. I would not have in hand what I needed to take. I would waste time, get left behind. I found my handbag and a set of keys and a summary John&#x2019;s doctor had made of his medical history. When I got back to the living room the paramedics were watching the computer monitor they had set up on the floor. I could not see the monitor so I watched their faces. I remember one glancing at the others. When the decision was made to move it happened very fast. I followed them to the elevator and asked if I could go with them. They said they were taking the gurney down first, I could go in the second ambulance. One of them waited with me for the elevator to come back up. By the time he and I got into the second ambulance the ambulance carrying the gurney was pulling away from the front of the building. The distance from our building to the part of New York&#x2013;Presbyterian that used to be New York Hospital is six crosstown blocks. I have no memory of sirens. I have no memory of traffic. When we arrived at the emergency entrance to the hospital the gurney was already disappearing into the building. A man was waiting in the driveway. Everyone else in sight was wearing scrubs. He was not. &#x201c;Is this the wife,&#x201d; he said to the driver, then turned to me. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m your social worker,&#x201d; he said, and I guess that is when I must have known.<br><br>I opened the door and I seen the man in the dress greens and I knew. I immediately knew.&#x201d; This was what the mother of a nineteen-year-old killed by a bomb in Kirkuk said on an HBO documentary quoted by Bob Herbert in <i>The New York Times</i> on the morning of November 12, 2004. &#x201c;But I thought that if, as long as I didn&#x2019;t let him in, he couldn&#x2019;t tell me. And then it&#x2014;none of that would&#x2019;ve happened. So he kept saying, &#x2018;Ma&#x2019;am, I need to come in.&#x2019; And I kept telling him, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m sorry, but you can&#x2019;t come in.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>When I read this at breakfast almost eleven months after the night with the ambulance and the social worker I recognized the thinking as my own.<br><br>Inside the emergency room I could see the gurney being pushed into a cubicle, propelled by more people in scrubs. Someone told me to wait in the reception area. I did. There was a line for admittance paperwork. Waiting in the line seemed the constructive thing to do. Waiting in the line said that there was still time to deal with this, I had copies of the insurance cards in my handbag, this was not a hospital I had ever negotiated&#x2014;New York Hospital was the Cornell part of New York&#x2013;Presbyterian, the part I knew was the Columbia part, Columbia-Presbyterian, at 168th and Broadway, twenty minutes away at best, too far in this kind of emergency&#x2014;but I could make this unfamiliar hospital work, I could be useful, I could arrange the transfer to Columbia-Presbyterian once he was stabilized. I was fixed on the details of this imminent transfer to Columbia (he would need a bed with telemetry, eventually I could also get Quintana transferred to Columbia, the night she was admitted to Beth Israel North I had written on a card the beeper numbers of several Columbia doctors, one or another of them could make all this happen) when the social worker reappeared and guided me from the paperwork line into an empty room off the reception area. &#x201c;You can wait here,&#x201d; he said. I waited. The room was cold, or I was. I wondered how much time had passed between the time I called the ambulance and the arrival of the paramedics. It had seemed no time at all (<i>a mote in the eye of God</i> was the phrase that came to me in the room off the reception area) but it must have been at the minimum several minutes.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>New World of Indigenous Resistance (City Lights Open Media)</h2><p><p>Indigenous societies throughout Latin America are facing difficult choices. After centuries of colonization, the ongoing struggle to preserve communal knowledge, rituals, language, traditions, teaching and learning practices has taken on even more significance in the increasingly standardized world of globalization. For many indigenous societies, protecting community-based customs has involved the rejection of state-provided education, raising a series of interconnected issues regarding autonomy, modernity and cultural sustainability.</p><p>In <em>New World of Indigenous Resistance</em>, these questions are approached from multiple perspectives by means of an innovative exchange between linguist and human rights advocate Noam Chomsky, and more than twenty scholars, activists and educators from across the Americas.</p><p>Two interviews with Chomsky open the exchange with lessons from world history, linguistics, economics and anti-authoritarian philosophy, parallel histories of peoples worldwide who have resisted state power while attempting to sustain or even revitalize community traditions. In response to Chomsky's ideas, voices from Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Peru, the United States and Uruguay dray from their first-hand experience and scholarship, speaking to, with, and at times against Chomsky's views. In a final interview Chomsky reflects upon the commentaries; the result is a nuanced intellectual and political exchange&#x2014;a compelling conversation that offers a contemporary vision of indigenous resistance, survival and hope.</p><p>"Two direct interviews with Chomsky enhance this articulate examination of challenges facing indigenous peoples today, including a positive viewpoint of means by which indigenous cultures can resist total assimilation, endure and spread hope. Highly recommended."&#x2014;<em>Midwest Book Review</em></p><p>"The key issue facing indigenous peoples as they gain new rights and raise their profile within Latin America's newly democratic states is how to reconcile the cultural inheritance that makes them indigenous with forces that aim to tether them to national identities or unleash upon them the corrosive acculturation implied by globalization. . . . This collection of commentaries &#x2013; framed by the wisdom of Noam Chomsky&#x2014;offers an excellent point of departure for the student interested in addressing such questions. With a significant focus on education, the writers address the thorny yet timeless issue of how to reconcile the ancient with the modern. . . .

He studied linguistics, mathematics and philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1955, he received his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania and began teaching at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he is Institute Professor Emeritus in the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy.</p><p>During the years 1951 to 1955, Chomsky was a Junior Fellow of the Harvard University Society of Fellows. While a Junior Fellow he completed his doctoral dissertation entitled, &#x201c;Transformational Analysis.&#x201d; The major theoretical viewpoints of the dissertation appeared in the monograph Syntactic Structure, which was published in 1957 and is widely credited with having revolutionized the field of modern linguistics. This formed part of a more extensive work, The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory, circulated in mimeograph in 1955. Most of a 1956 version was published in 1975.</p><p>In 1961, Chomsky was appointed full professor in the Department of Modern Languages and Linguistics (now the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy) at MIT. From 1966 to 1976 he held the Ferrari P. Ward Professorship of Modern Languages and Linguistics. In 1976 he was appointed Institute Professor, a position he held until 2002.</p><p>Chomsky is the author of numerous influential political works, including <em>Failed States</em> (Metropolitan Books), <em>Hegemony or Survival: America&#x2019;s Quest for Global Dominance</em> (Metropolitan Books), <em>9/11</em> (Open Media Series/ Seven Stories Press), <em>Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media</em> with Ed Herman (Pantheon), <em>Necessary Illusions</em> (South End Press), <em>Understanding Power</em> (New Press), <em>Interventions</em> (Open Media Series/ City Lights), <em>Hopes and Prospects</em> (Haymarket) and many other titles.</p><p>In 1988, Chomsky received the Kyoto Prize in Basic Science, given "to honor those who have contributed significantly to the scientific, cultural and spiritual development of mankind." The prize noted that "Dr. Chomsky&#x2019;s theoretical system remains an outstanding monument of 20th century science and thought. He can certainly be said to be one of the great academicians and scientists of this century."</p><p>"The key issue facing indigenous peoples as they gain new rights and raise their profile within Latin America's newly democratic states is how to reconcile the cultural inheritance that makes them indigenous with forces that aim to tether them to national identities or unleash upon them the corrosive acculturation implied by globalization. . . .

Whether your dog is highly reactive, noncompliant, or simply stubborn, this book teaches you effective techniques--from the basics and beyond--that encourage an obedient and cooperative canine companion.</p><p>PEGGY O. SWAGER is an award-winning writer and experienced pet behaviorist who hosts clinics on dog training, gives demonstrations on training techniques, and helps solve canine training issues with problem dogs. In 2002, she won the Dog Writers Association of America award for best training article. Peggy regularly contributes training articles to several dog magazines and continues to help teach people to resolve issues with difficult-to-train dogs. She lives in Monument, Colorado.Pet behaviorist and winner of the 2002 Dog Writers Association award for best training article, Swager has written a manual that debunks the idea that independent-thinking, dominant dogs must be trained using aversive methods. She begins by explaining characteristics that make certain breeds more difficult to train. She then discusses how a dog's pack position influences its desire to comply, and she demonstrates how a person can become the leader of the pack. She covers basic obedience commands and addresses problem behavior, e.g., housebreaking accidents, excessive barking, biting, and guarding. Unlike TV dog-training personality Cesar Millan, who believes in the alpha roll (holding a dog down on its side or back), or Kathy Santo (<i>Kathy Santo's Dog Sense</i>), who recommends the "jerk and pull" correction method, Swager espouses positive reinforcement. Other recent books such as Tamar Geller's <i>The Loved Dog</i> and Dale Stavroff's <i>Let the Dog Decide</i> also explain motivational methods; however, the beautiful and sometimes humorous color illustrations, the easy-to-read style, and the emphasis that all dogs, regardless of temperament, can benefit from reward-based training make this book an outstanding addition to public library collections.<b>--Florence Scarinci, Nassau Community Coll.

Scouting seems to rely on experience and intuition, scoring on performance metrics and statistics. In <i>Scouting and Scoring</i>, Christopher Phillips rejects these simplistic divisions. He shows how both scouts and scorers rely on numbers, bureaucracy, trust, and human labor in order to make sound judgments about the value of baseball players.</p><p>Tracing baseball&#x2019;s story from the nineteenth century to today, Phillips explains that the sport was one of the earliest and most consequential fields for the introduction of numerical analysis. New technologies and methods of data collection were supposed to enable teams to quantify the drafting and managing of players&#x2015;replacing scouting with scoring. But that&#x2019;s not how things turned out. Over the decades, scouting and scoring started looking increasingly similar. Scouts expressed their judgments in highly formulaic ways, using numerical grades and scientific instruments to evaluate players. Scorers drew on moral judgments, depended on human labor to maintain and correct data, and designed bureaucratic systems to make statistics appear reliable. From the invention of official scorers and Statcast to the creation of the Major League Scouting Bureau, the history of baseball reveals the inextricable connections between human expertise and data science.</p><p>A unique consideration of the role of quantitative measurement and human judgment, <i>Scouting and Scoring</i> provides an entirely fresh understanding of baseball by showing what the sport reveals about reliable knowledge in the modern world.</p></p><p>This book narrates the symbiotic relationship of human judgment (scouting) and statistics (scoring) in baseball, showing that they have been intertwined throughout baseball&#39;s history.<b>Christopher J.

Although from different backgrounds (Gilot from cosmopolitan Paris, Alther from small-town Tennessee) and different generations, they found they have a great deal in common as women who managed to support themselves with careers in the arts while simultaneously balancing the obligations of work and parenthood.&nbsp;<br><i><br>About Women&nbsp;</i>is their extended conversation in which they talk about everything important to them: their childhoods, the impact of war on their lives and their work, and their views on love, style, self-invention, feminism,&nbsp;and child rearing. They also discuss the creative impulse and the importance of art as they ponder what it means to be a woman.</p><p>LISA ALTHER was born in 1944 in Tennessee. She is widely known for her first novel,&nbsp;<i>Kinflicks</i>&nbsp;(1975), a feminist coming-of-age narrative that broke new ground in terms of what could be written and talked about. She is the author of seven additional works of fiction, a memoir, and a narrative history of the Hatfield-McCoy feud. Her books have been published in seventeen languages and have appeared on bestseller lists worldwide. <br><br>FRAN�OISE GILOT was born in 1921 in Paris.

We read a lot about the effect of war on the combatants but not that much about its effect on civilians. Can you say something about how war affected you as a child?&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>FG: My maternal grandmother had five children, two of whom died when they were quite young, leaving two sons and my mother, the youngest. The child my grandmother loved best was named Andr�. He was wounded at the front and died on November 1, 1918, from a shrapnel wound to the liver. The armistice occurred on November 11, 1918. Just when my grandmother thought that her two sons had escaped the war, she learned the tragic news. Andr� was only twenty-�three years old. She had had a special relationship with him, so for her it was as if life ended right then and there. <br><br>On the third floor of her home in Neuilly, there was a small room where her sons, my uncles, both of them officers, had collected all sorts of paraphernalia from the different phases of the war. Many photographs were pinned to the walls, as well as warmaps with little flags on pins for the various events. This room was left as it had been when Andr� died. On the walls, one could see all these black-�and-�white photographs, some taken from the sky, of destroyed villages and cathedrals and bridges, charredforests, trenches. It was a room entirely full of destruction.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> LA: Why did your uncles do this?&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>FG: I think they were so involved in the fight that destruction had grown inside them. They had had to withstand so much horror, and perhaps it was a catharsis to objectify their feelings on the walls of that room.<br><br>Years later, when I entered it for the first time, it felt very strange. I was five years old. It was quite frightening. There were also some half-�exploded bombshells that looked like dark and ghostly flowers. My grandmother called that room the War Room.I thought it was the Death Room.<br><br>My mother and grandmother installed a seamstress there with a sewing machine. They were planning dresses for me, both in velvet. My mother&#x2019;s design was to be made of royal blue velvet in a cut called princess, with a little bodice to the waist and a skirt that was corolla-�shaped, like a flower.<br><br>Whereas my grandmother&#x2019;s dress design was modern, Art Deco, straight, and very short, with assorted bloomers since it was so short that it showed my bottom. It was turquoise blue because she felt that was the color that suited me best. From her samples of turquoises, I had selected the one I wanted, as I also had for my mother&#x2019;s royal blue.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>I was intrigued and pleased to touch the samples of velvet. I chose the material that felt the softest. Then they showed me both pieces of fabric, and I watched the transformations leading from the material to the finished dresses. Maybe it&#x2019;s even more striking to me in retrospect, because, as a painter, I also give things shape and color. They had drawn models, and the seamstress cut the material and assembled the parts to look like the sketches. It was the first time I had any inkling of that kind of transformation. Paradoxically, this lovely and so feminine process was taking place in that strange room.<br><br>LA: Did it have photos of dead people also?<br><br>FG: No, just those photographs of ravaged landscapes and all the destruction.<br><br>LA: Did you have any idea what it meant?<br><br>FG: Yes, the adults were often talking about the Great War. Everybody was still fixated on it, maybe because of so many losses and hardships. The war had ended only in November 1918. I was five in 1927, so these events were not so far away.<br><br>Yet people were also living in the present, enthused over Josephine Baker and fast cars. The war, which concerned death, provided, by contrast, a reference point for life.<br><br>To me, it was all very mysterious and morbid. That seamstress, who could have worked in any other room, had been set up precisely there, with the sewing machine and a life-�sized dummy (similar to those in Giorgio de Chirico&#x2019;s paintings). The scene reminded me of the story of the sleeping princess who, when she goes up to the tower (the abode of an old crone who is in fact a bad witch in disguise), pricks herself with the tip of a spindle. She goes to sleep for a hundred years, along with everyone else in the castle.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>So for me, the fact that the seamstress was in that room with a needle in hand was dangerous. I hesitated between interest in what was going on&#x2014;�that transformation of a piece of cloth into a dress&#x2014;�and terror of a more drastic metamorphosis. The dress my mother had designed, instead of having simply a hem at the bottom, was scalloped. There were teeth, like arcs of circles, and there were also small arcs to end the little sleeves. I thought that was clever and unusual, and maybe also a magical protection.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>The name of that seamstress was Ad�le, and she was beautiful in a dark, classical way. I always liked the letter A, maybe because it&#x2019;s the first letter of the alphabet. I preferred a woman&#x2019;s name to start with an A or end with one. I thought that Ad�le was a strange name. I liked the sound of the A and the d, but not the &#x201c;�le.&#x201d;<br><br>On top of it all, there was a silly song in French that had a leitmotif: &#x201c;Car elle est morte Ad�le, Ad�le ma bien aim�e.&#x201d; And in French &#x201c;morte Ad�le&#x201d; is heard as &#x201c;mortadelle,&#x201d; the name for an Italian sausage. So it meant, &#x201c;She&#x2019;s dead, Ad�le my beloved,&#x201d; but it also meant that she was an Italian sausage. And since she was in the War Room with all its reminders of death, I just couldn&#x2019;t think of anything other than that stupid song.<br><br>I guess that, unconsciously, my mother and grandmother wanted to transcend the war with something specifically soft and feminine. They were not conscious of it themselves, for sure, but I suspect that&#x2019;s why they selected that sad room in which to establish the seamstress.<br><br>LA: The good witches, sewing their spells. What an image!<br><br>My very first memory is from when my father came back from World War II. He was wearing his olive army jacket. I must have been about three. I think we were at a cabin in Tennessee in which his parents lived briefly after they gave us their house. I remember him looming over me, backlit by a lightbulb in the ceiling, and I remember the floor. It was linoleum, black-�and-�white squares. And I remember a gold-�and-�brown snake, a copperhead, I now realize, slithering across those black-�and-�white squares.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>FG: A snake, an actual snake?<br><br>LA: Yes, a real snake. It had gotten into the kitchen somehow. My grandfather chased it out the back door and chopped its head off with a shovel.<br><br>I felt a kind of horror about the whole situation. My mother and I must have been very close while my father was gone. I was a baby, and she was probably lonely and unhappy, left alone to cope with my two-�year-�old brother, John, and me. But now my father was back. <br><br>FG: Oh, that&#x2019;s quite a symbolic memory. The living paradise . . .<br><br>LA: Paradise lost. He was back, and the next thing I knew, my second brother, Bill, had been born.<br><br>FG: Was your crib in your mother&#x2019;s room until then?<br><br>LA: I&#x2019;m not sure. When I was ten days old, my father went to boot camp in Pennsylvania, leaving my mother and older brother, John, and me at his parents&#x2019; house. He was assigned to an army base in Cheyenne, Wyoming, so we followed him out there from Tennessee in our car. My mother drove thirty-�five miles per hour to spare the tires and save gas, so it must have taken us many days to get there.<br><br>John sat in the front seat beside my mother. She said he talked nonstop, and she focused on him because she didn&#x2019;t want him to feel replaced by the new baby (me) or upset by his father&#x2019;s disappearance. Later on, when I started talking, she said my first complete sentence was &#x201c;Mommy, please make John stop talking all the time.&#x201d;<br><br>My car seat was an orange crate on the floor of the backseat. It must have been very unsettling for a new baby, all alone on that shadowy floor, the car swaying, not knowing where I was or where my mother was or what was happening. The seat back was very high and padded, and my mother couldn&#x2019;t really hear me over John&#x2019;s chatter and the music on the radio and the roar of the engine and the hum of the tires on the road. So I was unable to signal when I was wet or hungry or frightened. I was fed and changed whenever we stopped for gas or for meals.<br><br>Once we reached Wyoming, my father was sent to Abilene, Texas, and we followed along in the car. I&#x2019;ve seen some photos from Abilene, including one of my parents and my brother taken on Thanksgiving Day, but I don&#x2019;t appear in any of them. It makes me wonder if they&#x2019;d forgotten me on the back floor of the car.<br><br>In Abilene, my father, who was a doctor, was put on a troop train with the window shades closed. It was a secret mission, and we weren&#x2019;t told where he was going.<br><br>He ended up in England, after a voyage across the North Atlantic on a troopship that was swarmed several times by German submarines. He talked of his horror at watching oil slicks and body parts and debris from the destroyed subs rise to the surface ofthe ocean. During one attack, he had to perform an emergency appendectomy using dinner forks as retractors because someone had forgotten to send along any surgical instruments. He received some kind of medal for this feat. One of his main jobs was to give shots of penicillin to the several hundred soldiers with syphilis on board.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Meanwhile, my mother and John and I drove back to my grandparents&#x2019; in Tennessee. And eventually we drove to my mother&#x2019;s home in upstate New York, where we lived in a cottage on a lake with two of my aunts and their children. Their husbands were also away fighting in the war.<br><br>I traveled forty-�two hundred miles in my orange crate during my first ten months, and I lived in seven different places by the time I was two and a half, to say nothing of all the motels we stopped at during our travels. It&#x2019;s no wonder I became a bit of a nomad once I grew up.<br><br>I&#x2019;m told I woke up crying many nights during this upheaval, at about 3:00 a.m. My poor mother would walk me to calm me down. But when she tried to put me back in my crib, I&#x2019;d start crying again and wake up John, so she sometimes brought me back into bed with her. I can imagine that having been alone all day in the orange crate, I must have needed some human contact&#x2014;�too bad for me that it was given by an exhausted and annoyed mother and only to shut me up.<br><br>No doubt my happy hours in my mother&#x2019;s bed ended abruptly when my father came back. He used to complain that I was a show-�off, making cute faces at neighboring tables when we went out to dinner and rolling down the lawns outside restaurants in my smocked dress. But I was probably just trying to retrieve some of the attention I&#x2019;d lost upon his return and the birth of my baby brother. <br><br>I hate to say it, but the tragedy for many babies born during wars was not that their fathers went away but rather that they came back! We never bonded with our fathers as infants, or they with us, because they weren&#x2019;t around.<br><br>After my parents&#x2019; deaths, I read in my mother&#x2019;s daybook from the year of my father&#x2019;s return that he hit me in the head with a golf club. She gives no details, and it was never mentioned later on. I assume it was an accident, but I wish I knew for sure.<br><br>I must have complained a lot that I wasn&#x2019;t a boy because I remember my mother always saying to me, &#x201c;Yes, but you&#x2019;re our only little girl.&#x201d; What I minded most was that unlike my brothers I couldn&#x2019;t pee standing up. Despite this handicap, I did believe Iwas a boy for several years. In the summer, I wore only shorts, no shirt, like my brothers. But when I was about six, the other kids started making fun of me, so I began wearing shirts. That same year, I started school and discovered I couldn&#x2019;t wear jeans as my older brother did but instead had to wear dresses. This was a horrible shock.<br><br>When my father came home from working at the hospital, whoever was sitting in his chair had to move. My mother, who had been working just as hard as he all day, jumped up and began to serve him. Sometimes he went straight to bed with a headache, and she brought him a meal on a tray. But if she were sick, he was always at work. Marriage didn&#x2019;t look like a fair deal to me.<br><br>FG: It seemed to me also that men were much more privileged in life than women. I had a tendency to say, &#x201c;Yes, what a pity I&#x2019;m not a boy.&#x201d;<br><br>At the same time, my grandmother was telling me, &#x201c;A woman is in no way inferior to a man, only different.&#x201d;<br><br>I just couldn&#x2019;t make sense of all that. Why should you think it was so impressive to be a woman when obviously women got the short end of the stick? All their preaching about feminism fell on deaf ears at that time.<br><br>Also, they were always talking about the Virgin Mary. But I wasn&#x2019;t interested in the Virgin Mary in the least. It&#x2019;s convenient because in Catholicism monotheism is mitigated. You can choose to be devoted to the aspect that you prefer. I didn&#x2019;t feel allthat much enthusiasm for God the Father, and Christ was an ascetic, a little bit alien to my nature. The Holy Ghost was the only one of the Trinity I was interested in. The spirit of creation was my thing. I could understand it. I thought it was marvelous.</p><h2>Grace Against the Clock (A Manor House Mystery)</h2><p><i>When Marshfield Manor hosts a charity event, Grace Wheaton, the mansion&#x2019;s curator and manager, is happy to lend a helping hand&#x2014;until a killer makes an unwanted donation...</i><br><br>With the town clock in desperate need of repair, local lawyer Joyce Swedburg and her ex-husband, Dr. Leland Keay, are trying to put their differences aside to organize a benefit at Marshfield Manor to raise money to restore the beautiful timepiece.

A native Chicagoan, she thoroughly enjoys researching her books, especially when traveling to exciting new places is involved.<b>Chapter 1</b><p>Joyce Swedburg tucked her fingers into the crook of Bennett&#x2019;s right arm. &#x201c;Dear man, it&#x2019;s been too long. How have you been?&#x201d; Without waiting for a reply, the statuesque woman draped her free hand over the other and pressed close, hugging the way a toddler might cling to a parent&#x2019;s leg. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re as handsome as ever, you devil you.&#x201d; Her lips spread into a serviceable smile as she turned to address her companion. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you agree, Leland?&#x201d;<br>Frances nudged me&#x2014;like there was any chance I might miss Ms. Swedburg&#x2019;s over-the-top performance.<br>Dr. Leland Keay extended his hand to Bennett. &#x201c;Good to see you again.&#x201d;<br>Almost as tall as my boss, Keay&#x2019;s dark features contrasted with Bennett&#x2019;s fair skin and white hair. Keay was younger, by about twenty years, and beginning to sprout gray at his temples. This, along with his Barry White voice, made him quite the attractive package.<br>He was dressed in a tweed hunting jacket that sported suede elbows and a matching patch at one shoulder. His white shirt was starched, his slacks expertly creased. Handsome and successful, Dr. Leland Keay was widely considered to be Emberstowne&#x2019;s most eligible bachelor.<br>I&#x2019;d encountered Keay several times as we prepared for the fund-raiser scheduled for tomorrow night and had come to the opinion that, eligible or not, the rest of Emberstowne&#x2019;s single ladies could keep him. Even though he was a world-renowned cardiothoracic surgeon with a reputation for being witty and charming, I found that Keay carried himself with a faint disregard for others and a perpetual absentminded air.<br>Keay and Bennett shook hands vigorously&#x2014;the way men do when they&#x2019;re happy to see one another but not comfortable enough to hug. The action should have dislodged Joyce Swedburg from her perch at Bennett&#x2019;s side, but the woman held on for dear life. Both to Bennett&#x2019;s arm and to her achingly artificial cheer.<br>The five of us were gathered in a wide, empty section of Marshfield Manor&#x2019;s basement. Accessible via a single stairway, it offered a fun, unusual spot to throw a giant party. And that&#x2019;s precisely what we planned to do.<br>Two connecting rooms had been reserved for our festive fund-raiser. This, the main section of the party area, would be set up for glittering socialites to enjoy appetizers and drinks. A perfect spot for mingling until the show began. The expansive space was airy and inviting, thanks to creative lighting and creamy-yellow brick walls. The ceiling was brick, too, crafted into neat, arched rows. At our feet was the kind of creaky wooden flooring you might find in an old department store or VFW dance hall. It gave the place charm.<br>Because we were belowground and centrally located beneath the mansion, no natural light streamed in. In a burst of brilliance, Joyce had arranged to rent six giant flat-screen televisions to serve as faux windows. These had been installed the day before, positioned vertically on two facing walls, and had been programmed to display live views from the highest vista of the closest mountaintop. If you looked closely, you could even see tiny Emberstowne bustling below.<br>With the dynamic &#x201c;windows&#x201d; in place, this main mingling area could have been mistaken for a refurbished warehouse loft in a gentrified urban setting. Banquet-sized and gorgeous, this section had never been included in any public tours. If we ever decided to utilize this area in the future, I&#x2019;d consider making the flat-screen installation permanent.<br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell you how delightful it is to be working with you again, Bennett.&#x201d; Joyce wagged a finger near his chin. &#x201c;Your insights at the Chamber of Commerce have been missed.&#x201d;<br>Bennett acknowledged her compliment. &#x201c;And I am sorry to have relinquished my seat there. Unfortunately, I&#x2019;ve been occupied with many other endeavors. I hope you understand that I couldn&#x2019;t occupy a spot if I was incapable of delivering my best efforts.&#x201d;<br>She tugged his arm closer and rested her head against his shoulder. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve more than made up for it with your generous endowments.&#x201d;<br>Sliding sideways, Bennett extricated himself from her double-handed clutch. &#x201c;Grace and Frances have been keeping me updated with your plans. We are honored that you&#x2019;ve chosen to host the benefit here at Marshfield.&#x201d;<br>Joyce floated away from Bennett as though it had been her idea to break their physical connection. &#x201c;There is no more perfect setting in all of Emberstowne. Except perhaps beneath the Promise Clock itself. But can you imagine having this affair in the streets? Then anyone would be able to join the party.&#x201d; She gave a dramatic shudder. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t allow that.&#x201d;<br>The Chamber of Commerce, with Joyce as volunteer event planner, intended to raise money to refurbish the area surrounding the giant town clock, which had served as an unofficial entrance to Emberstowne for more than a hundred years. Named the Promise Clock because the citizens at the time believed that Emberstowne held great promise for success and prosperity, it lightly resembled Le Gros Horloge in Rouen, France.<br>The Promise Clock, which had lived up to its titular reputation until recently, was colossally sized. Set in the center of a massive archway that connected two now-abandoned buildings, the Renaissance-inspired glory differed from Le Gros Horloge in a couple of key ways: Our town&#x2019;s clock, though somewhat less ornate, sported both hour and minute hands; and the edifice&#x2019;s span was almost double that of its French predecessor.<br>That the arch&#x2019;s width allowed for two-way traffic to pass beneath it was not the problem&#x2014;the lack of traffic was. Very few residents traveled through that part of town anymore.<br>Over the past several years, in one of the ripple effects of the Great Recession, the touristy section of Emberstowne had begun to condense. Businesses at the edge of town had either moved to a more central location or shuttered completely. The establishments already on Main Street, like Hugo&#x2019;s and other mainstays, had weathered the rough patch and were now enjoying a resurgence of business, but the area surrounding the Promise Clock had become a ghost town.<br>With weeds sprouting in the middle of the pavement, unrepaired sidewalks, and lonely buildings with broken windows, the only promise it held now was that this was an area best avoided. Though rich in history, the stretch was sorely lacking in commerce, making it Emberstowne&#x2019;s biggest embarrassment. If it weren&#x2019;t for the presence of the clock, the entire section of town might have been razed.<br>Tomorrow night&#x2019;s fund-raiser had been conceived when costs to improve the roads and landscaping and to help smarten up the buildings far overran original estimates.<br>Despite the deterioration of the surrounding area, the clock&#x2019;s inner workings ran on time and Emberstowne had expended the effort necessary to keep the clock&#x2019;s face unmarred. In the past year, however, experts had noted structural problems. At the recent switch to daylight savings time, a worker who had crawled inside the arch to adjust the hands had nearly fallen through when the crumbling construction disintegrated beneath him.<br>All maintenance updates on the clock had been halted until a full overhaul and repair of the arch could be done. That took time. And money.<br>Tomorrow night&#x2019;s benefit sought to solicit contributions from wealthy benefactors willing to donate a thousand dollars per person for the privilege of attending the Marshfield party. Bennett had generously offered to supply the space as well as the food. He&#x2019;d also purchased tickets for a few of us on staff, to attend as his guests.<br>Although I&#x2019;d been in contact with Joyce over the past few months, she&#x2019;d been working most closely with our catering staff and with Terrence, our chief of security. Today was the first time she and Leland had shown up together. Until now I&#x2019;d believed she was simply the head of the clock benefit committee and he the president of the Chamber of Commerce. I hadn&#x2019;t been aware that the two had been married to each other once upon a time. Frances had provided that little tidbit moments ago.<br>Bennett waved his hand as though to encompass the space around us. &#x201c;I must confess, however, to being surprised when Grace told me that you&#x2019;d chosen this particular room for the party.&#x201d;<br>I whispered to Frances, &#x201c;How long have they been divorced?&#x201d;<br>My assistant got that eager-to-gossip gleam in her eye. Drawing a hand up in front of her mouth while ogling the two in question&#x2014;a conspicuous gesture that practically screamed that we were talking about them&#x2014;she murmured, &#x201c;Five years.&#x201d; Her tadpole brows leaping high with glee, she added, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s quite a story there.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not now,&#x201d; I said.<br>Joyce was nearly as tall as her ex-husband. She sauntered over to him, ran a hand down the length of his tailored jacket sleeve&#x2014;I could only imagine how soft that luxurious fabric was&#x2014;and addressed Bennett over her shoulder. &#x201c;Leland first suggested we hold the event upstairs in your foyer and adjoining rooms, but he has no imagination, do you, Leland?&#x201d;<br>He didn&#x2019;t answer. Arm-rub or no, he didn&#x2019;t appear to be paying attention.<br>Joyce reached the far end of the space and turned around with an expression that was half bored, half amused. I got the impression that this woman had been born to perform. She extended both arms, hands upraised, looking a great deal like the Imperia statue in Konstanz, Germany, though offering far less cleavage, thank goodness.<br>Raising her voice, she adopted a beleaguered tone. &#x201c;Everyone who visits Marshfield has seen the foyer,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Hundreds&#x2014;no&#x2014;thousands of people pass through your front doors each day, clutching their precious tickets. And what do they see first? The foyer. Forgive me, Bennett, but it&#x2019;s not special.&#x201d;<br>Leland wandered to the far end of the first room, stopping at the juncture where it ended and a small hallway leading to the auditorium began.<br>The doctor raised his voice to be heard over Joyce&#x2019;s. &#x201c;Where are the bathrooms?&#x201d;<br>Joyce rolled her eyes. &#x201c;Why on earth are you worried about that now?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Why do you think?&#x201d;<br>She held a hand to her forehead and briefly closed her eyes. &#x201c;You see what I have to deal with?&#x201d;<br>Leland turned to me. &#x201c;Quite a few of my patients are attending. Several are elderly and may be experiencing incontinence issues.&#x201d;<br>I answered him. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re down the alcove to your left.&#x201d;<br>He pointed. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s to the right?&#x201d;<br>We&#x2019;d been over this before. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s where David Cherk will be presenting &#x2018;A History of the Promise Clock&#x2019; for the guests,&#x201d; I said. David Cherk was a lauded, eccentric photographer who was regularly called upon to chronicle historic moments, and whose work adorned the interiors of most of Emberstowne&#x2019;s municipal buildings. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the auditorium.&#x201d;<br>We used the term auditorium loosely. There were no seats, no lights, no sound system, no stage. Like an auditorium, however, the room was fan-shaped, wide at the entrance and narrow at the deep end, which was where the presentation would be held.<br>Keay disappeared to inspect the accommodations. I exchanged a glance with Frances. Among my concerns with holding the event down here were fire exits, capacity, and washroom facilities. There was only one official entrance to the space, down a narrow stairway that led from an EMPLOYEES ONLY door on the main level. We would have security officers stationed there tomorrow night to assist guests in finding their way to the party. But if anything should happen that might cause people to stampede out, the restricted egress had the potential to become a dangerous bottleneck.<br>Weeks ago, at my urging, Joyce had agreed to meet with a representative from the fire department to ensure that the event wouldn&#x2019;t violate code. We&#x2019;d gotten the all-clear, but I still would have preferred to hold the benefit on Marshfield&#x2019;s main level. I was certain that we could have found a location that was special enough for this gala event.<br>Although there was only one official door to the party space, an emergency exit had been added some years back, probably when the mansion first opened to visitors. It evacuated into the employee underground garage, and accessing the exit involved hitting a crash bar, which set off ear-splitting alarms.<br>I wandered that way now, as Bennett, Joyce, and Frances chatted among themselves. Ahead of me, the auditorium was dark. I tried to envision how David Cherk&#x2019;s entertainment would play out. He was due here soon. We&#x2019;d set up this last-minute meeting between all parties for late in the day, when the mansion was closed to visitors. I wandered back into the main room and glanced at my cell phone to check the time. Almost as if I&#x2019;d been clairvoyant, the device signaled a text.<br>Joyce, Frances, and Bennett looked up. &#x201c;David Cherk is here,&#x201d; I announced as I pulled up my walkie-talkie to alert Terrence to show the man in. Right on time.<br>&#x201c;Oh dear.&#x201d; Joyce held a palm up to her powdered cheek. &#x201c;That man gives me the creeps. He has odd opinions about the strangest things. So precise and peculiar.&#x201d; She shook her head and tsked loudly.<br>I understood where Joyce was coming from, though we could do without the theatrics. David Cherk wasn&#x2019;t the sort of person I&#x2019;d choose to hang out with in my free time, but Joyce&#x2019;s comment still rankled.<br>With three skinny, black-clad assistants in tow, Cherk descended into our midst. The first time I&#x2019;d met him, I&#x2019;d been convinced that he purposely sucked in his cheeks. After a few minutes of conversation, however, I&#x2019;d come to understand that his skeletal look wasn&#x2019;t an affectation. Right now, as he smiled in greeting, I marveled at how mirth could appear so cold.<br>&#x201c;Good afternoon, everyone,&#x201d; he said to us in his sharp, starchy voice. &#x201c;Are we all ready for the breathtaking presentation I have planned for tomorrow night?&#x201d; He gave an exultant sigh as he clasped his long-fingered hands together in front of his chest. &#x201c;So few of our citizens make time to visit the historical office to learn about our town and experience my artistry.

But no matter how hectic life gets, she can always pick up the scent of a howling good mystery--and she'll stop at nothing to dig up the truth. . .<br><br>It's summer in Connecticut, and Melanie's life has become an endless string of dog shows, soccer camp, and the antics of her energetic toddler. She hardly has time to pay much attention to her Aunt Peg's new prot�g�, Nick Walden, a self-proclaimed "dog whisperer" with an uncanny gift for decoding dog-speak. The well-heeled dog owners of Fairfield County are lapping up his alleged talents, anxious to discover exactly what their pampered pets are thinking--that is until the pooches start spilling their secrets. <br><br>When Nick is discovered dead in his home, his sister Claire enlists Melanie to help track down the killer. Now, as she juggles the demands of marriage and motherhood--not to mention her six beloved Poodles--Melanie can scarcely even begin to nose through the growing list of suspects. But just when she thinks she's barking up the wrong tree, she'll find herself face to face with a purebred murderer. . .</p><p>LAURIEN BERENSON is an Agatha and Macavity nominee, winner of the <i>Romantic Times</i> Reviewers' Choice Award, and&nbsp;four time winner of the Maxwell Award, presented by the Dog Writers Association of America.

On board they are joined by a coterie of acquaintances, including American industrialist Caleb P.

But very soon the pleasant voyage dissolves into an atmosphere thick with chaos, intrigue and vicious gossip, followed by a series of suspicious accidents and a sudden death. And with harsh weather and rough seas making the crossing even more perilous, it&#39;s up to Daisy and Alec to uncover the tangled secrets and hidden agendas of some very dangerous guests...</p><p><p><b>Carola Dunn</b> is the author of several series of novels, including Regency romances, the Daisy Dalrymple mysteries, the Cornish mysteries, and more than two dozen stand-alone novels.</p>&nbsp; 1<i>M</i>other will never forgive me,&#x201d; said Daisy. She clutched her bouquet of rosebuds in one hand and smoothed the skirt of her cream linen costume with the other as the big, green Vauxhall pulled smoothly away from the kerb in a shower of confetti.&#x201c;For marrying me?&#x201d; asked Alec softly, glancing at the chauffeur&#x2019;s back.&#x201c;Oh no, darling. She&#x2019;s been resigned to my marrying a policeman ever since she discovered you&#x2019;re a Detective Chief Inspector, not a humble bobby. Besides, an unmarried daughter of twenty-six is a fearful reproach to someone of her generation.&#x201d; Daisy heard herself babbling but couldn&#x2019;t stop. After all, she had never been married before, and it felt most peculiar. &#x201c;Where Mother&#x2019;s concerned,&#x201d; she continued, &#x201c;it doesn&#x2019;t hurt that <i>your</i> mother disapproves of me quite as much as mine disapproves of you.&#x201d;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid so,&#x201d; he admitted, &#x201c;but Belinda adores you. Almost as much as I do.&#x201d;When he looked at her like that, it was hard to believe those grey eyes were capable of making an erring subordinate snap to attention or freezing a criminal to the marrow of his bones. &#x201c;Alec, my hat!&#x201d; she squeaked, as he enveloped her in a crushing embrace.Though she was unable to speak for several minutes, her ears were unencumbered. She distinctly heard Bill Truscott chuckle as he drove the Vauxhall, its hood down on this sparkling October day, towards the Dorchester Hotel. That was the worst of old retainers.The loan of the motor and chauffeur was the least of what Daisy&#x2019;s cousin Edgar, Lord Dalrymple, had provided. He had done them proud, in spite of the short notice. Coming over all dynastic, he had begged to give the bride away and to provide a bang-up reception. Daisy hadn&#x2019;t had the heart to refuse, knowing how guilty the ex-schoolmaster felt at having inherited Fairacres and the viscountcy after her father&#x2019;s death in the &#x2019;flu pandemic of &#x2019;19.Her father ought to have been there to give her hand to Alec, he or her brother, Gervaise, killed in the Flanders trenches. And it might have been Michael who placed the ring on her finger, if that land-mine had not blown up his Friends&#x2019; Ambulance Unit. A catch in her throat, Daisy blinked.She loved Alec dearly, but her sight was misty as she glanced back at the following motor-cars. The first bore Cousin Edgar, the Dowager Lady Dalrymple, and Daisy&#x2019;s maid of honour, her erstwhile housemate, Lucy Fotheringay. The second, Alec&#x2019;s cherished Austin &#x201c;Chummy,&#x201d; was driven by his sergeant, Tom Tring, who had stood as his best man. In the back seat, Mrs. Fletcher sat poker-stiff with Alec&#x2019;s ten-year-old daughter, Belinda, bouncing slightly at her side.It was a small wedding party, just what Daisy had wanted but not at all what her mother considered proper.&#x201c;She&#x2019;ll never forgive me the Registry Office,&#x201d; Daisy sighed, &#x201c;since she had her heart set on St. George&#x2019;s, Hanover Square. Darling, I&#x2019;m frightfully glad Superintendent Crane gave you so little notice of your fortnight&#x2019;s leave.&#x201d;&#x201c;So am I, since it pleases you, love.&#x201d; Alec&#x2019;s dark, rather fierce eyebrows met in a frown. &#x201c;Yet I have a nasty feeling he&#x2019;s got something up his sleeve.&#x201d;&#x201c;Oh, Alec, he <i>can&#x2019;t</i> ask you to investigate a crime while we&#x2019;re on our honeymoon!&#x201d;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I suggested a week in Jersey. The Channel Islands have their own legal system, which is none of our business. And I haven&#x2019;t mentioned to anyone at the Yard that we&#x2019;ll spend the second week at home. No, I suspect the Super has something special in store for when I go back to work.&#x201d;&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s not worry about it now, then, darling. Oh, here we are. You squashed my flowers. Is my hat straight?&#x201d;The reception was on a completely different scale from the wedding. In spite of the short notice, few of those invited failed to attend. The Dorchester&#x2019;s ballroom was crammed with Daisy&#x2019;s aristocratic family connections, Alec&#x2019;s Metropolitan Police colleagues, and an eclectic collection of friends.Daisy made friends easily and, according to her mother, without discrimination. Standing in the receiving line, the Dowager Lady Dalrymple was forced to shake hands with, among others, an Indian doctor, an American industrialist, and a Russian Jewish violinist.&#x201c;I knew if you insisted on working for a living you were bound to meet the most unsuitable people,&#x201d; she moaned, &#x201c;but need you make <i>friends</i> of them?&#x201d;&#x201c;Buck up, Mother,&#x201d; Daisy whispered. &#x201c;Here come Lord and Lady Wentwater. I wrote an article about Wentwater Court, remember?&#x201d;In spite of their unfortunate connection with her work, an earl and countess could not fail to please. For the moment at least, Daisy was spared further reproaches.Another &#x201c;suitable&#x201d; guest was the Honourable Phillip Petrie, who had grown up on the estate next to Fairacres. Lady Dalrymple&#x2019;s only objection to him was that he had not married Daisy. It was not for want of trying. As Gervaise&#x2019;s closest chum, he had long felt honour-bound to take care of Gervaise&#x2019;s little sister, which led him to propose to her at regular intervals.Daisy having refused him with equal regularity, he had recently married an American girl. He appeared to be utterly besotted with his golden-headed Gloria, whom he generally addressed&#x2014;revoltingly&#x2014;as Glow-worm.<br>&nbsp;Later on, after cutting the wedding cake, Daisy and Alec were talking to Phillip and Gloria when Gloria&#x2019;s father, Mr. Arbuckle, approached. Curiously, he was accompanied by Detective Superintendent Crane, with whom he appeared to be on unnaturally friendly terms.They were an oddly assorted pair, and the uniform of formal morning cutaways and striped trousers only served to accentuate the contrast. The American millionaire was short and spare, his long face lengthened by a receding hair-line. The English policeman stood well above the regulation height, his bulk still muscular (thrice weekly games of fives, according to Alec), his sandy hair fading but still thick.Mr. Arbuckle looked smug, Superintendent Crane bland in a way Daisy had long since concluded all detectives must practise in front of their looking-glasses. She regarded him with suspicion.&#x201c;He <i>does</i> have something up his sleeve,&#x201d; she muttered.Catching her words, Gloria glanced back. &#x201c;Yes, Poppa&#x2019;s been up to something,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what, but he&#x2019;s in cahoots with Superintendent Crane, I do believe. I&#x2019;ve seen them with their heads together, haven&#x2019;t you, honey?&#x201d;Phillip&#x2019;s conventionally handsome face remained blank. In anyone she knew less well, Daisy might have supposed he was aware of whatever plot was hatching and was attempting to conceal his knowledge. In Phillip, however, blankness of face denoted blankness of mind. Put him down in front of a motor-car engine and his capabilities amounted to near genius, according to his poppa-in-law. Little else, always excepting his young bride, was able to stir his brain cells into action.&#x201c;Er, yes,&#x201d; he agreed uncertainly, smoothing his already sleek, fair head.Arbuckle and Crane were upon them. The usual congratulations for the groom and wishes for the bride&#x2019;s happiness were repeated. During the brief pause that followed, Daisy caught a hint of embarrassment marring the Super&#x2019;s placid fa�ade. He turned his head towards his fellow conspirator.&#x201c;Waal, have I got a surprise for you folks,&#x201d; said Arbuckle, beaming. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m tickled to death, Fletcher, to be able to tell you I&#x2019;ve been pulling strings in Washington on your account. See, our noo President, Mr. Coolidge, wants to clean up the Investigation Bureau of the Justice Department&#x2014;that&#x2019;s like our national police&#x2014;and boy oh boy, do they need it! Orgian stables isn&#x2019;t in it, trust me.&#x201d;He smirked, pleased with himself at this classical reference. After a momentary vision of mounted police indulging in orgies, Daisy translated it as Augean stables. Her school had not considered Greek and Latin suitable for feeble female minds, but tales from the myths, properly bowdlerized, were staples.&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard rumours,&#x201d; Alec admitted with caution.&#x201c;Graft&#x2019;s the word, right from the top. Burns, the Director, has been using federal employees to run his own &#x2019;tec agency. Waal, to cut a long story short, I got put onto this smart young guy who&#x2019;ll likely end up as the boss man. I talked to him on the transatlantic telephone and convinced him he needed to consult with Scotland Yard.&#x201d;&#x201c;And the S�ret�,&#x201d; put in Superintendent Crane dryly.&#x201c;Gotta be fair to our gallant allies, sir, or at least look like it. Anyways, as I was about to say, there&#x2019;s no police department back in the States that&#x2019;s worth a dime, not when it comes to big ideas for organizing things on a sound, honest basis. And once I&#x2019;d talked round this J. Edgar Hoover guy, your Commissioner was easy as pie.&#x201d;&#x201c;I hope you won&#x2019;t let him hear you say that!&#x201d; Crane exclaimed, not a little put out.&#x201c;All I mean is, he&#x2019;s a reasonable guy,&#x201d; Arbuckle hastened to assure him.Daisy, the sinking feeling in her stomach reaching rock-bottom, decided it was time to learn the worst. &#x201c;But what was the Commissioner reasonable about?&#x201d; she demanded.Arbuckle beamed at her, triumphant. &#x201c;Why, first he agreed to send a man over to advise young J. Edgar, and then he agreed that Detective Chief Inspector Fletcher is the best man for the job.&#x201d;&#x201c;But we&#x2019;re only just married!&#x201d; Daisy wailed, seizing Alec&#x2019;s arm and hanging on tight. Alec put his hand over hers and opened his mouth, but Gloria got in first.&#x201c;Poppa, how could you!&#x201d;&#x201c;Now, now, honey, let your old poppa finish. I&#x2019;m mighty sorry, Mrs. Fletcher&#x2014;I should&#x2019;ve started at the other end. You&#x2019;re going too, see, all expenses paid.&#x201d;&#x201c;Oh, but I couldn&#x2019;t possibly accept ...&#x201d;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not me that&#x2019;s paying, not but what I would, and be happy to. I owe you big, you and Fletcher, and don&#x2019;t you think I&#x2019;ll ever forget it. While you&#x2019;re in the States, I surely hope&#x2014;we hope, don&#x2019;t we, honey?&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll be our guests at my little country place.&#x201d;&#x201c;Gee, sure thing, Poppa. That&#x2019;s a swell idea.&#x201d;&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll all sail together on the SS <i>Talavera.</i> But there&#x2019;re others than me glad to pay your fare, Mrs. Fletcher. Yes siree, I&#x2019;ve been talking to your editors, here in Lunnon and over in Manhattan. Here&#x2019;s a cable from N&#x2018;York and a letter from the Lunnon guy. You&#x2019;ll see both of &#x2019;em want articles about the voyage and your impressions of America.&#x201d;Daisy was speechless, thrilled certainly, yet nettled at being manipulated. While she scanned the two messages, Alec turned to Crane.&#x201c;I was promised two weeks&#x2019; leave, sir,&#x201d; he said flatly.The Superintendent&#x2019;s face remained bland, but he had a twinkle in his eye. &#x201c;Keep your hair on,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You get a nice week&#x2019;s sea cruise each way, courtesy of H.M. Government; and what&#x2019;s more, it&#x2019;s a bonus. The <i>Talavera</i> leaves Liverpool on the Wednesday after you&#x2019;re due back on duty.&#x201d;&#x201c;Ah.&#x201d; Alec remained cautious. &#x201c;What about this invitation to stay with Arbuckle?&#x201d;&#x201c;Your return voyage is booked. If you finish in Washington before the time&#x2019;s up, what you do next is up to you.&#x201d; Drawing Alec a little aside, Crane lowered his voice. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell you this in confidence. Arbuckle has a certain amount of influence over here, and we can&#x2019;t ignore a request from the American Government. However, what persuaded the A.C. to let you go for so long is the prospect of six weeks without Mrs. Fletcher&#x2019;s getting herself mixed up in any investigations.&#x201d;&#x201c;My mother ...? Oh, Daisy!&#x201d;Crane chuckled. &#x201c;Anything she does in America is out of <i>our</i> jurisdiction; and whatever happens there, <i>you</i> will at least have peace on board ship.&#x201d;&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Alec said hopefully, &#x201c;she can&#x2019;t possibly get into trouble aboard.&#x201d;TO DAVY JONES BELOW.

Yet one of the most common questions new writers ask professional writers is about <i>how</i> the author wrote their book, what was their process for storytelling (and from this we get plotters and pantsers)? But really the question should be about the general principles and nature of <i>story</i>--does every part of a story have what it needs to keep readers turning the pages (regardless of how the author got there)? Does every scene, every part of the story support the strategic narrative objective of providing new information a scene will inject in the story (the key principle of writing fiction)?<br><br> In <i>Great Stories Don't Write Themselves</i>, Larry Brooks has developed a series of detailed checklists backed by tutorial content for novelists of every level and genre to refer to as they write regardless of which writing method they prefer. Beginning with the broadest part of <i>story</i>, the early checklists help writers to ensure that their book is based on a premise (aka plot) rather than an idea, or how you can elevate your idea into an actual premise where other story elements can be developed. <i>Great Stories Don't Write Themselves</i> gradually hones in on other story elements like hero empathy, dramatic tension, thematic richness, vicariousness of story, narrative strategy, scene construction, etc. each with their own checklists with specific, actionable items that ensure that key principle (providing information to move the story forward) occurs.</p><p></p><h2>The Third Rule Of Ten: A Tenzing Norbu Mystery (Tenzing Norbu Mysteries)</h2><p>Keep current with the truth: we are only as weak as our secrets; especially the ones we keep from ourselves. That;s the Third Rule of Ten. As the go-to private detective for a bevy of high-profile clients, our beloved ex-Buddhist monk, ex-Lapd officer, Tenzing Norbu, has finally found his stride. With his beautiful pathologist girlfriend, a healthy bank account, and a steady stream of clients, courtesy of middle-aged movie star Mac Gannon and rising political star Bets McMurtry's life is bursting with activity. But its not all joy and happiness. The death of his father and a growing abundance of secrets both personal and professional leave feeling an unexpected depth of sorrow and confusion. Even with the emotional turmoil, nothing can stop Ten from taking the case when McMurtry's housekeeper goes missing. The investigation leads him down a dangerous path littered with bodies, untraceable prescription drugs, and human organ trafficking. But nothing is as shocking as the realization that the mastermind behind it all is none other than Chaco Morales, a criminal that slipped through&nbsp; hands once already. The Third Rule of Ten will have readers on the edges of their seats, as they learn, along with Ten, that there is a fine line between healthy privacy and unhealthy secrecy. Knowing the difference may just determine whether Ten will stop Chaco or lose himself.</p><p>Gay Hendricks, Ph.D., has served for more than 35 years as one of the major contributors to the fields of relationship transformation and body-mind therapies.

Stephen Knight and Thomas Ohlgren set out to correct this discrepancy in their comprehensive collection of all pre-seventeenth-century Robin Hood tales. The editors include such other outlaw figures as Hereward the Wake, Eustache the Monk, and Fouke le Fitz Waryn to further contextualize the tradition of English outlaw tales. In this text the figure of Robin Hood can be viewed in historical perspective, from the early accounts in the chronicles through the ballads, plays, and romances that grew around his fame and impressed him on our fictional and historical imaginations. This edition is particularly useful for classrooms, with its extensive introductions, notes, and glosses, enabling students of any level to approach the texts in their original Middle English.</p><p>Stephen Thomas Knight was until September 2011 Distinguished Research Professor at Cardiff University in the School of English, Communications and Philosophy; and is currently a Vice-Chancellor&#39;s Fellow of the University of Melbourne and Honorary Research. Thomas H. Ohlgren is Emeritus Professor of English and Medieval Studies at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, where he has taught since 1969 when he received his Ph.D. in English Language and Literature from the University of Michigan. His scholarship focuses on the earliest surviving written accounts of Robin Hood, ranging from the chronicles of Andrew of Wynton (c. 1420), John Bower (c. 1440), John Major (1521) and Richard Grafton (1569), to the early ballads and plays, which include Robin Hood and the Monk, Robin Hood and the Potter, the Gest of Robyn Hode as well as several short plays. Ohlgren is less interested in finding the original, historical figure, which he believes does not exist, than in tracing the evolution of the medieval outlaw tale, such as Hereward the Wake, Eustace the Monk, and Fulk fitz Warin, which contain characters, plot elements, and themes too close to be accounted for by coincidence.</p><h2>By Their Father&#39;s Hand: The True Story of the Wesson Family Massacre</h2><p><p>Neighbors were unaware of what went on behind the tightly closed doors of a house in Fresno, California&#x2014;the home of an imposing, 300-pound Marcus Wesson, his wife, children, nieces, and grandchildren.

Henry Timberlake: The Story of a Soldier, Adventurer, and Emissary to the Cherokees, 1756-1765</h2><p>Lt. Henry Timberlake's <i>Memoirs</i> provide the most detailed account of Cherokee life in the eighteenth century. Timberlake visited the Cherokee Overhill towns for three months in 1761-62 and accompanied three Cherokee leaders to London to meet with King George III and other political figures. He died in September 1765, around the time the <i>Memoirs</i> were originally published.<br><br>This first modern edition of Timberlake's <i>Memoirs</i> is abundantly illustrated with portraits, maps, and photographs of historical, archaeological, and reproduced artifacts, bringing a new dimension to Timberlake's rich portrayal. Assembled for an exhibit produced by the Museum of the Cherokee Indian, this collection of period artifacts, artwork, and traditional items made by contemporary Cherokee artists is a stunning representation of the material culture--both native and British--of the French and Indian War period. A detailed introduction and extensive editorial notes help interpret this 250-year-old chronicle for the modern reader, drawing heavily from historical research and archaeological investigations of the last half-century while still including insights offered by Samuel Cole Williams in the original American version published in 1927.<br><br></p><p>This is the first modern scholarly edition of what is considered the most detailed ethnographic account of Cherokee life in the late 18th century. Timberlake�s memoirs describe the months he spent living with the Cherokees then escorting a delegation to London to meet King George III. He provides details of daily life, including ceremonies, games, the role of women, the preparation of food, and the creation of weapons, baskets, and pottery. This edition pairs the original text with extensive footnotes and annotiations, a new introduction, index, and more than 100 illustrations, including artifacts, maps, period artwork, and contemporary artwork.Duane H.

Today, the autocratic Orbitals indulge in decadent luxury far above the mudboys, dirtgirls, zonedancers, and buttonheads who live out violent lives of electronic distraction and dependence amid the flooded, ruined cities and teeming slums of a balkanized America.<br><br>But there are heroes; those who would stand against the Orbital powers and keep freedom's cause alive. Two such heroes are the metal-eyed ex-fighter pilot turned panzer-driver Cowboy, and Sarah, the cybernetic assassin desperate to find a better life for her drug-addicted brother. Together, Cowboy and Sarah embark on a high-octane odyssey across the shattered face of the American west.<br><br>From Walter Jon Williams comes Hardwired, the hard-hitting, seminal classic that feels as prescient today as when it was first published. Like a steel-guitar fueled Damnation Alley, as directed by Sam Peckinpah, Hardwired demonstrates how Williams's singular vision helped defined the cyberpunk genre.<br><br>Skyhorse Publishing, under our Night Shade and Talos imprints, is proud to publish a broad range of titles for readers interested in science fiction (space opera, time travel, hard SF, alien invasion, near-future dystopia), fantasy (grimdark, sword and sorcery, contemporary urban fantasy, steampunk, alternative history), and horror (zombies, vampires, and the occult and supernatural), and much more. While not every title we publish becomes a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, a national bestseller, or a Hugo or Nebula award-winner, we are committed to publishing quality books from a diverse group of authors.</p><p><p><strong>Walter Jon Williams </strong>has been nominated for every major science fiction award, including Hugo and Nebula award nominations for his novel <em>City on Fire</em>. His books include <em>The Sundering</em>, <em>The Praxis</em>, <em>Destiny's Way</em>, and <em>The Rift</em>. He lives near Albuquerque, New Mexico, with his wife.</p>After his thoughtful, elegant novel Knight Moves, Williams wrenchingly shifts gears for this heavy-metal adventure. It is set with acknowledgement in Roger Zelazny's Damnation Alley, when corporate Orbitals control what's left of a postwar America, now balkanized and armed to the teeth. Ex-fighter pilot Cowboy, "hardwired" via skull sockets directly to his lethal electronic hardware, teams up with Sarah, an equally cyborized gun-for-hire, to make a last stab at independence from the rapacious Orbitals. The story, though, is buried under an elaborate techno-punk style of the sort William Gibson popularized in Neuromancer. In both cases, it is a pose, a baroque nostalgia for Hemingway and film noir; it only plays at nihilism, terror and despair. The best effect is Williams's future version of a brain-scrambled vet: a dead buddy of Cowboy's whose scattered bits and pieces of computer memory now constitute a ragged semblance of a man. Such nuggets are hard to find amid the amplified, rock-'n-roll prose. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Deportees: and Other Stories</h2><p><b>Stories that take a new slant on the immigrant experience, from the Booker Prize-winning author of <i>Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha</i></b><br><br><b>Watch for Roddy Doyle&#x2019;s new novel, <i>Smile</i>, coming in October of 2017</b><br><br>Roddy Doyle has earned a devoted following amongst those who appreciate his sly humor, acute ear for dialogue, and deeply human portraits of contemporary Ireland. <i>The Deportees</i> is Doyle's first-ever collection of short stories, and each tale describes the cultural collision-often funny and always poignant-between a native and someone new to the fast-changing country. From a nine-year- old African boy's first day at school to a man who's devised a test for "Irishness"to the return of <i>The Commitments</i>'s Jimmy Rabbitte and the debut of his new multicultural band, Doyle offers his signature take on the immigrant experience in a volume reminiscent of his beloved early novels.</p><p>Roddy Doyle is an internationally bestselling writer.

He lives in Dublin.<p> </p>"<i>The Deportees</i>&nbsp;confirms Doyle's standing as a rare genius of socially conscious literary comedy. . . . His mastery of the ordinary Dubliners' speech informs all these stories and lends them an urgent credibility."<br> <i><b>--Los Angeles Times</b></i><b><i><br><br> </i></b>"Doyle's short stories rest on the comical limitations--and emotional largess--of his Irish characters. . . .

Calling herself Riverbend, she offered searing eyewitness accounts of the everyday realities on the ground, punctuated by astute analysis on the politics behind these events.</p><p>In a voice in turn eloquent, angry, reflective and darkly comic, Riverbend recounts stories of life in an occupied city&#x2014;of neighbors whose homes are raided by US troops, whose relatives disappear into prisons and whose children are kidnapped by money-hungry militias. At times, the tragic blends into the absurd, as she tells of her family jumping out of bed to wash clothes and send e-mails in the middle of the night when the electricity is briefly restored, or of their quest to bury an elderly aunt when the mosques are all overbooked for wakes and the cemeteries are all full. The only Iraqi blogger writing from a woman&#x2019;s perspective, she also describes a once-secular city where women are now afraid to leave their homes without head covering and a male escort.</p><p>Interspersed with these vivid snapshots from daily life are Riverbend&#x2019;s analyses of everything from the elusive workings of the Iraqi Governing Council to the torture in Abu Ghraib, from the coverage provided by American media and by Al-Jazeera to Bush&#x2019;s State of the Union speech. Here again, she focuses especially on the fate of women, whose rights and freedoms have fallen victim to rising fundamentalisms in a chaotic postwar society.</p><p>With thousands of loyal readers worldwide, the Riverbend blog is widely recognized around the world as a crucial source of information not available through the mainstream media.

Grade 5 Up&#x2014;This volume examines Lincoln's lifelong interest in technology and inventions and how he introduced these "new and useful things" to the nation. The 19th century saw transformations in transportation and industry, and many of these innovations were utilized by the North in its victory over the South. Offering an overview of the war, the book presents chapters on topics including Lincoln's pre-inauguration train trip to Washington in February 1861, the North's Anaconda Plan for blockading Southern ports, surveillance balloons, the ironclads, new guns and ammunition, and&#x2014;most importantly&#x2014;the telegraph and railroads. The lively, well-researched text makes it clear that Lincoln grasped the concept of "total war" and did not hesitate to exploit the latest know-how to ensure victory. Nineteenth-century photos, reproductions, and political cartoons appear throughout, each with an informative caption. Time lines and numerous sidebars treating topics such as the Emancipation Proclamation or Morse code are also included. An outstanding section of online resources sifts out sites of "especially high value." This book is a vital addition to the Lincoln shelf and an exceptional and novel approach for students investigating the Civil War.&#x2014;<i>Patricia Ann Owens, Wabash Valley College, Mt.

She enjoys creating exuberantly colourful and fun decorated lettering as well as preparing more serious and formal calligraphic work within the commercial world. A Fellow of the Calligraphy and Lettering Arts Society and a Fellow of the Society of Scribes and Illuminators, Jan has been teaching for twenty years. On the birth of Prince William, she was commissioned to prepare the gilded scroll which was presented to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to commemorate the occasion. A typical week for Jan is a delightful mix of teaching calligraphy, meeting lots of people and working to deadlines within the commercial world, be it lettering or illustrating. As she says &#39;It&#39;s a real pleasure and I feel very lucky to do something that I find so enjoyable.&#39;June 2016 If you&#39;ve got the taste for calligraphy, then this is a great bok to take you forward to the next stage of your lettering journey. A real treasurefor anyone who loves writing, this book contains a woprld of inspiring calligraphic instructions, and ideas for decorating lettering to make them visually exciting, interesting and appropriate to the subject matter. So whether you want to personalise your wedding stationary, or create unique greetings cards, decorated letterinh can transform even the mundane into something personal and beautiful. * Love to Make * Pitched rather nicely between craft and calligraphy, this is a project book for those who aspire to what we might call fancy pen-work. It starts with some useful guides to techniques and letterforms before moving on to more freestyle work. This then develops into a look at ways of decorating letters that could be described as informal illumination. This is a book for those who want to have some fun rather than make a serious study, and it&#39;s none the worse for that. Further ideas, under headings such as &#34;going dotty&#34; and &#34;fun with pastels&#34;, follow and there are hints, tips and demonstrations where and when they&#39;re required. The whole is relaxed and colourful while also being informative and inspiring and it&#39;s an easy book to like. * Artbookreview.net * A really good and inspiring book for all levels - it starts with a very clear introduction to basic equipment and technique suitable for a beginner before outlining how to write 8 useful abd varied alphabets. The rest of the book is where it gets really interesting - a whole bunch of ways to make your lettering eye-catching and beautiful. Pencil crayons, watercolour, embossing, printing gilding and more - all covered in enough detail to help you make a start and the photos inspire you to want to try. Fascinating for beginners and more experienced calligraphers. However, readers should be aware that this is a &#34;learn how&#34; book not a &#34;copy a project from start to finish&#34;book - and all the better for that. * Karen Bibby * This is a beautifully illustrated and informative book on creating beautiful imagery with letters. The books introduces the reader to different means of creating decorated letters from the well known calligraphy to freestyle hand drawn and coloured. Each section shows you how to create the letters, gives information on technique such as spacing, barrel size and the right tools to use. It also includes templates and craft ideas so you can use the book as a starting point and then let your imagination run wild with crafting possibilities. A perfect book for anyone who enjoys craft activities, makes their own cards or wants to make their own wedding stationery. I found the instructions in the book relatively easy to follow and was able to produce some lovely gift labels for a birthday present using the techniques - it took around 45-60 minutes to create the first and then as I was more confident around 30 mins for the consecutive ones. * Ellie Spider * i really love this book my daughter and i are always looking for great ways to decorate items we upcycle and this book is so nicely laid out its given us so many ideas the only issue we have is which ones to use * Leanne Perrett * Continuing with the multitude of lettering books that are being published at the moment, this book by Jan Pickett is included because it extends the discipline of calligraphy and brings it right into the present with a combination of traditional and modern approaches. In many books on calligraphy, much time is spent on the different fonts. Here, this is done with eight examples but the information is restricted to a double page spread for each. Enough information is given to enable you to practice them but the body of the book is given over to how to decorate and embellish the basic lettering and give them colour, verve and excitement. Jan Pickett is one of the country&#39;s top calligraphers and the work included here is simply wonderful. There are 13 chapters which include using colour (watercolour, gouache and pastel), masking fluid, wet and dry techniques and embossing. This fascinating book is full of colour, materials, ideas and processes and it makes the whole subject look great fun. Coupled with the illustrations, this is a perfect starting point for sketchbooks. The step by step instructions show you how to layer masked washes, make borders, use pointillism, work on shadows and use paper masks, and all these would make great creative ice-breakers for sketchbook work.

In a journal she kept under her pillow, Susy documented her world-famous father-from his habits (good and bad!) to his writing routine to their family's colorful home life. Her frank, funny, tender biography (which came to be one of Twain's most prized possessions) gives rare insight and an unforgettable perspective on an American icon. Inserts with excerpts from Susy's actual journal give added appeal.</p><p>Barbara Kerley is a two-time Sibert Honoree and a Boston Globe-Horn Book Honoree whose award-winning biographies include <i>What to Do About Alice?</i>, <i>The Extraordinary Mark Twain (According to Susy)</i>, <i>Those Rebels, John &amp; Tom</i>, and <i>A Home for Mr. Emerson</i>, illustrated by Edwin Fotheringham, <i>Tigers &amp; Tea With Toppy</i>, illustrated by Matte Stephens, and <i>The Dinosaurs of Waterhouse Hawkins</i> and <i>Walt Whitman: Words for America</i>, illustrated by Brian Selznick.

How would the story of your days read when channeled through those shrewd, �judgmental eyes? Would you seem like God when God walked in the garden, or would you seem like Papa Doc, the tyrant, the crafter of rules and breaker of �treaties? <br><br>This is what happened to Mark Twain. His 13-year-old daughter, Susy, in secret, chronicled his life. From her notes, the source of a great new book &#x2014; \u201cThe Extraordinary Mark Twain\u201d &#x2014; you can conclude either that he was the best father who ever lived, or that he was simply favored by his era, that time before muckraking memoirs and celebrity-daughter tell-alls. Or perhaps a bit of both. <br><br>Written by Barbara Kerley and illustrated by Edwin Fotheringham, \u201cThe Extraordinary Mark Twain\u201d began with one of those tantalizing tidbits writers sometimes stumble across. Kerley, whose previous works include \u201cWhat to Do About Alice?\u201d and \u201cWalt Whitman: Words for America,\u201d happened to spot a footnote about a \u201cbiography\u201d that Susy, Twain\u2019s eldest daughter, had written. \u201cI was immediately intrigued,\u201d Kerley writes in an author\u2019s note. \u201cHaving been the parent of a 13-year-old girl myself, I know they tend to call it like they see it.\u201d <br><br>Kerley has used Susy\u2019s text, from a notebook filled with the neat cursive of the day, to construct a kind of dual bio�graphy, the story of Twain and the story of Susy telling the story of Twain. Every few pages, Kerley includes samples of the journal, minibooks stapled to the spine: \u201cHis favorite game is billiards,\u201d Susy writes, \u201cand when he is tired . . . &nbsp;he stays up all night and plays. . . . It seems to rest his head.\u201d <br><br>Twain is the great hero of American literature, the father of us all, the author of \u201cThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,\u201d but also the world traveler and story-spinner. Kerley gives us a quick sketch of the boy who became the artist, the early years in Hannibal, Mo., the life of the steamboat pilot, the life of the newspaperman and the life of the young author. It\u2019s a story told also in Fotheringham\u2019s pictures, which suggest works of American folk art &#x2014; the side-wheelers crowding the harbor, the green hills above the river town, the author laughing as he reads his own book. <br><br>But more than the public man, what you get here is the husband and father, the private figure named Samuel Clemens. The authors &#x2014; by the end, Barbara Kerley and Susy Clemens seem like co-authors of this book &#x2014; tell you what you want to know about Twain: He paced the floor between courses at meal time; he threw his shirts out the window; he wrote all day, breakfast till dinner, filling 50 pages at a pop; he talked to the cat; he hid from fans but now and then got stuck when (Susy quoting Twain) \u201cmentally dead people brought their corpses with them for a long visit.\u201d <br><br>Susy\u2019s physical description of her father fills me with joy, as it\u2019s just the way a man wants to be seen by his progeny: \u201cHe has beautiful curly gray hair, not any too thick, or any too long, just right; a roman nose, which greatly improves the beauty of his features, kind blue eyes, and a small mustache. . . . In short he is an extrodinarily fine-looking man. All his features are perfect exept that he hasn\u2019t extrodinary teeth.\u201d <br><br>Other than that last part, I mean. <br><br>Though Susy began writing in secret, Twain soon discovered what she was up to. \u201cAfter that,\u201d Kerley writes, \u201cPapa sometimes made pronouncements about himself at the breakfast table just to help his bio�grapher along.\u201d Years later, Twain published parts of Susy\u2019s diary in The North American Review,</p><h2>Psychedelic Bubble Gum: Boyce &amp; Hart, The Monkees, and Turning Mayhem into Miracles</h2><p><p>From the man who wrote the songs that outsold the Beatles and the Rolling Stones in 1967-1968, comes the story of the first decades of his life in Hollywood and New York.&nbsp;</p><p>Immerse yourself in Grammy, Golden Globe, and Academy Award nominated songwriter Bobby Hart&#x2019;s world as he shares the story behind his success; from humble beginnings comes a musical goliath.</p><p><i>Psychedelic Bubble Gum </i>is an exclusive glimpse into Hart&#x2019;s personal journey as he moves on the fast track to fame. This vivid narrative follows Hart&#x2019;s gradual rise in the music industry as half of the duo Boyce and Hart, as he and his friend and partner Tommy Boyce wrote the songs that launched the Monkees to stardom, and eventually reaching over a hundred million in sales. Along the way is all the heartbreak and drama that accompanies fame and fortune&#x2015;an uprooted life, conflicted morals, and the sacrifice of his wholesome high school sweetheart Becky.</p><p>With unbending sincerity, Hart details a life of extravagance, betrayal, loss, disillusionment, and an unstoppable personal struggle to find spiritual balance, peace, and love. <i>Psychedelic Bubble Gum </i>is a rollercoaster ride through the 1960s and 1970s during America&#x2019;s whirlwind era of free speech, mysticism, and psychedelic pop culture, and, of course, rock &#x2018;n&#x2019; roll.

As an Academy Award, Golden Globe and Grammy Award-nominated composer he has sung, written and/or produced highly successful songs for himself as well as bands like the Monkees.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hart wrote his first two top ten songs in 1964 with his best-known writing partner, Tommy Boyce. The duo wrote <i>Hurt So Bad, Come A Little Bit Closer and Not Your Steppin&#x2019; Stone</i> as well as the Monkees first hit single, <i>Last Train to Clarksville </i>and album, <i>The Monkees. </i>They also made numerous songs for television and motion pictures and spearheaded the Let Us Vote campaign, lobbying Congress to lower the voting age to eighteen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bobby continues to write and administer his music publishing interests, while devoting more time and energy to his commitment to meditation, service to others, and public speaking. As a result of writing his memoir, Bobby has developed various keynote speeches and seminars. &nbsp; <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Glenn Ballantyne is a writer and entrepreneur.

While struggling to make it in Hollywood, Hart listened to the radio and detected an unsatisfying insincerity in the DJ&#x2019;s voice. Hart&#x2019;s desire for authenticity, and his connections in entertainment, would go on to propel him on a remarkable journey through the music world. He left his hometown of Phoenix to start six months of active duty in the U.S. Army Reserve in Monterey, California, and soon found himself entangled in the glamour and grit of Hollywood&#x2015;that &#x201c;circus of extremes for the senses with its bright lights and colorful characters&#x201d;&#x2015;while working for a company that manufactured labels for vinyl records. His own recording career, though, began one fateful Saturday, when he booked studio time for himself and became amazed at the possibilities that emerged when he combined his musical background with skillful sound engineering. What followed were years of risk and uncertainty and powerful collaborations with other musicians&#x2015;as well as love, loss, and friendship. Hart candidly depicts his hyperactive, out-and-about lifestyle as a musician and songwriter who struggled to balance the work that gave his life meaning with his commitment to his family. Sometimes the strain proved too much, and his relationship with his first wife deteriorated as a result. Along the way, countless projects with his songwriting partner, Tommy Boyce, rolled by, as did the tumultuous cultural and historical events of the 1960s. Before long, the duo was writing songs for The Monkees, including &#x201c;(Theme from)&nbsp;<i>The Monkees</i>,&#x201d; &#x201c;Last Train to Clarksville,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Valleri.&#x201d; In the memoir&#x2019;s most captivating pages, Hart recounts the stratospheric rise of that artificially engineered musical group. Particularly engaging are Hart&#x2019;s anecdotes about his own songwriting process; he recounts, for instance, that the song fragment that eventually became &#x201c;Last Train to Clarksville&#x201d; was inspired by a mishearing of the Beatles&#x2019; 1966 single &#x201c;Paperback Writer.&#x201d;</p><p>A highly detailed autobiography by a unique figure in American cultural history that will interest historians and pop-culture aficionados alike.</p> - - Kirkus Reviews</p><h2>Aerie (The Dragon Jousters, Book 4)</h2><p>In the fourth and final novel of Mercedes Lackey's <i>Dragon Jousters</i> series, Kiron, the man who had once been a dragon-boy called Vetch, has united the dragon riders and managed to rid their world of both war and magical domination.

Somebody might self-identify as spiritual but not religious. Or they might be a practicing Hindu, Buddhist or Muslim. Or they might call themselves an atheist, freethinker or agnostic. But the one thing that people never describe themselves as is a &#34;non-Christian.&#34; So Christians who want to &#34;reach non-Christians&#34; need to realize that they&#39;re not all the same. Evangelism is not one-size-fits-all. Luke Cawley shows how Christians can contextualize the gospel in different ways to connect with different kinds of people. Here he unpacks the religious identities of three key demographics: the spiritual but not religious, committed atheists and nominal Christians. Each group has particular characteristics and requires specific approaches and practices to make the Christian faith plausible, desirable and tangible to them. Filled with real-life stories of changed lives, this book is a practical and hopeful resource for helping people to encounter God.</p><p>Luke Cawley is the director and cofounder of Chrysolis, a UK-based ministry that helps organizations and churches better communicate the Jesus story. He developed missional communities on university campuses in Britain and Romania and is a regular speaker at conferences and outreach events around the world."The world of real estate is ruled by one word repeated thrice: location, location, location. In the real world of relationships, which is the <em>real</em> estate of life, one word reigns supreme: context, context, context. Luke Cawley has written the new go-to book for contextual apologetics. This book is everywhere thoughtful and judicious; it is wide-ranging and deeply illuminating." (Leonard Sweet, E. Stanley Jones Professor of Evangelism, Drew University, bestselling author of From Tablet to Table, creator of preachthestory.com)<br><br>"I am convinced that we need to rethink evangelism in light of the increasingly missionary situation of the church in our time. This is a top-class book that will help God's people do just that. We might just become a more genuinely good-news people in the process." (Alan Hirsch, author and activist)<br><br>"I've been equipped and inspired anew by this book to better understand and connect with the many different kinds of people who don't yet follow Jesus. Ditch the one-size-fits-all approach to being a witness: let this book help you do the things that may actually meet our friends' felt spiritual needs." (James Choung, national director of evangelism, InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA, author of True Story)<br><br>"I have read many books on helping people to faith in Christ, but this is one of the best. Perceptive, well-read, full of illustrative stories and extremely practical. Buy it and use it!" (Michael Green, theologian and evangelist)<br><br>"I recommend <em>The Myth of the Non-Christian</em> to any Christian interested in evangelism and apologetics. As a vocational minister, however, I would especially recommend it to other vocational ministers and church leaders. It will help us understand the challenges in reaching post-Christian Westerners for Christ as well as best practices for doing so." (George P. Wood, Influence, April 15, 2016)<br><br>"While many people think of apologetics and cringe for fear of engaging in heated, insensitive arguments, <em>The Myth of the Non-Christian</em> presents a refreshingly different perspective. Listen to people, love them, help them connect to Jesus in a way that makes sense to them. It's a simple yet profound concept that can transform the ways we engage people with the gospel. Luke Cawley winsomely communicates to people of diverse backgrounds that following Jesus makes intellectual sense and satisfies our deepest longings. This book is a gift to all of us who are seeking to share this message!" (Jessica Leep Fick, author of Beautiful Feet)<br><br>"Luke Cawley's book is a brilliant resource for anyone interested in any form of Christian apologetics&#x2015;for evangelists, teachers, pastors and indeed for anyone who wants to engage those who don't understand what Christ offers that the culture cannot. The book is full of captivating snippets of conversations you and I have every day. It will make every reader more able to understand those who do not know Christ and more able to present him in ways they can understand. Cawley covers the gamut of unbelievers&#x2015;skeptics, atheists, the unchurched and the spiritual but not religious. Importantly, Cawley is not afraid to engage the serious topic of spiritual reality. The text is highly accessible without compromising depth and should be read by all who ever want to talk with nonbelievers." (Mary Poplin, professor and author of Is Reality Secular?)<br><br>"A riveting back and forth between compelling principles of contextualized apologetics and life story. Luke speaks powerfully and prophetically about what apologetics in our day should look like as he gives the reader a fresh glimpse of what happens when our head and heart come together in our striving with people. Luke has an obvious love for God and for people. He paints a picture of what it looks like to do an apologetic and evangelistic ministry with impact and compassion. Theory, practice, heart, passion and presence&#x2015;few books bring this level of integration together as <em>The Myth of the Non-Christian</em>!" (R. York Moore, national evangelist, InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA)<br><br>"Real-life encounters, provocative sidebars, and questions at chapters' end help readers further interact with the book. The New Atheists and approaching nominal Christians are also considered. Recommended to anyone wanting to more effectively share the Gospel." (Gerald Wisz, CBA Retailers+Resources, March 16, 2016)<br><br>"Suppose Christians take seriously the call to spread the gospel, to answer questions about the faith and to give a reason for the hope that they have in Jesus Christ. If we shoulder this crucially important task, shouldn't we seek to engage and speak to actual people rather than our idealized notion of a 'non-Christian'? Absolutely! Luke Cawley shows us why and how. He combines a much-needed diatribe against 'one-size-fits-all' apologetics with some very practical and easily accessible suggestions on how engage in apologetics. I cannot imagine a better book for a community of people who desire to share their hope with a world that desperately needs Christ!"

These workers confronted a system of racial capitalism that consigned African Americans to the basest jobs in the industry, perpetuated low wages for all southerners, and shored up white supremacy. <br><br>Galvanized by the emergence of the CIO, African Americans took the lead in a campaign that saw a strong labor movement and the reenfranchisement of the southern poor as keys to reforming the South--and a reformed South as central to the survival and expansion of the New Deal. In the window of opportunity opened by World War II, they blurred the boundaries between home and work as they linked civil rights and labor rights in a bid for justice at work and in the public sphere. <br><br>But civil rights unionism foundered in the maelstrom of the Cold War. Its defeat undermined later efforts by civil rights activists to raise issues of economic equality to the moral high ground occupied by the fight against legalized segregation and, Korstad contends, constrains the prospects for justice and democracy today.<br><br></p><p>"Written in riveting prose, <i>Civil Rights Unionism</i> is a breathtaking account of how black tobacco workers joined forces with the organized left to create an amazingly resilient labor movement in one of the most powerful companies in the South. At the heart of the movement were black women who believed labor unions ought to do more than demand higher wages and better working conditions; they fought to eliminate racism and fight for dignity and social justice. Korstad not only forces us to rethink the origins of the 'modern' civil rights movement, but he demonstrates how Cold War repression redirected what might have been a very different civil rights movement had these visionary workers remained at the forefront."--Robin D.

How did a former Chicago newspaper editor bring together the stallion and mare and breed the winner of the world's most famous and important horserace? <br><br> Jim Squires's <i>Horse of a Different Color</i> tells the story of his wild ride from absurdity to glory at the pinnacle of horseracing success alongside Monarchos, the charismatic gray colt blessed with the extraordinary speed, poise, and stamina necessary to carry his motley band of human handlers to the highest level of their profession. <br><br> Squires takes you on an exciting journey through the close-knit and secretive world of horse breeders, buyers, sellers, owners, and trainers. And his hilarious tour of racehorse culture ends with a blazing sprint down the homestretch of the second fastest Derby in history in the company of a crowd of Kentuckians driven mad with "Derby Fever." <br></p><p><b>Jim Squires</b> has been breeding and raising horses in Kentucky since 1990. From 1981 to 1989, he was the editor of the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>. He is the author of two previous books. A Tennessee native, Squires lives with his wife Mary Anne at Two Bucks Farms in Versailles, Kentucky.After losing his job as the editor of the Chicago Tribune, Jim Squires turns his successful sideline of raising horses into a full-time enterprise. At first, the reading reminds us that author/editor Squires is not a professional audiobook performer. He sounds uneasy; the way a nonactor does when confronted with lines. Yet, as he relaxes into this fascinating, entertaining look at thoroughbreds and the singular folk involved in horse breeding and racing, his natural enthusiasm connects. With great good humor, Squires describes disappointing horse auctions, careful breeding practices, those afflicted with "the dreaded social disease, Derby Fever,'" and the business of raising Monarchos, a Kentucky Derby hopeful. Finally, we experience with Squires his unbridled delight when the gray colt wins "the most exciting two minutes in sports."

As CEOs, each approached strategy and execution in remarkably similar ways&#x2014;yet markedly differently from their erstwhile competitors&#x2014;keeping their focus on five rules:</p><ul> <li> Look Forward, Reason Back: They determined where they want their companies to be in the future and could "reason back" to identify the moves that would take them there.</li></ul><ul> <li> Make Big Bets, Without Betting the Company: All three men made enormous strategic bets but rarely took gambles that put the financial viability of their companies at undue risk.</li></ul><ul> <li> Build Platforms and Ecosystems: Technology leaders have to create industry platforms that enable other firms to create complementary products and services that make the platforms increasingly valuable.</li></ul><ul> <li> Exploit Leverage and Power: Gates, Grove, and Jobs often turned opponents&#x2019; strengths into weaknesses and used enormous resources (once they had them) to dominate competitors.</li></ul><ul> <li> Shape the Company around Your Personal Anchor: From Gates&#x2019; understanding of software to Grove&#x2019;s devotion to process discipline and Jobs&#x2019; obsession with design, all three built their companies around their personal strengths while compensating for their weaknesses.</li></ul><p><em>Strategy Rules</em> brings together the best practices in strategic management and high-tech entrepreneurship, providing unique insights for start-up executives as well as the heads of modern multinationals.</p><p>David B.

Using period training manuals, after-action reports, countless interviews with Panzer veterans, and his own experiences as an armor commander in the modern German Army, Schneider describes World War II Panzer tactics, coupling his narrative with scores of illustrations that highlight armor concepts. Schneider covers the major types of small-unit operational art-offensive and defensive-and also discusses road marches, reconnaissance, command and control, working with other arms of service, life in a tank, armor training, gunnery, and the future of armor. The book provides useful insight into armor tactics for both the layman and the armor enthusiast.</p></li></p><p>Wolfgang Schneider, an expert on German armor, lives in Germany.</p><h2>Playing With Fire: Feminist Thought And Activism Through Seven Lives In India</h2><p>Seven voices contribute to this rare glimpse of the work being done on the front lines of the fight for social change in India. Playing with Fire is written in the collective voice of women employed by a large NGO as activists in their communities and is based on diaries, interviews, and conversations among them. Together their personal stories reveal larger themes and questions of sexism, casteism, and communalism, and a startling picture emerges of how NGOs both nourish and stifle local struggles for solidarity. The Hindi edition of the book, Sangtin Yatra, published in 2004, created controversy that resulted in backlash against the authors by their employer. The publication also drew support for the women and instigated a public conversation about the issues exposed in the book. Here, Richa Nagar addresses the dispute in the context of the politics of NGOs and feminist theory, articulating how development ideology employed by aid organizations serves to reinforce the domination of those it claims to help. The Sangtin Writers, Anupamlata, Ramsheela, Reshma Ansari, Richa Singh, Shashibala, Shashi Vaish, Surbala, and Vibha Bajpayee, are grassroots activists and members of a small organization called Sangtin in Uttar Pradesh, India. Richa Nagar teaches women&#x2019;s studies at the University of Minnesota.</p><p>The Sangtin Writers, Anupamlata, Ramsheela, Reshma Ansari, Richa Singh, Shashibala, Shashi Vaish, Surbala, and Vibha Bajpayee, are grassroots activists and members of a small organization called Sangtin in Uttar Pradesh, India.

At the center of the Puritan experience, it continued in succeeding centuries to play a vital role&#x2014;as public ritual, occasion for passion and reflection, and, not least, popular entertainment. The fifty-eight sermons collected in this volume display the form&#x2019;s eloquence, intellectual rigor, and spiritual fervor. Ranging from the first New England settlements to mass-media evangelism and the civil rights movement in the 1960s, these texts reclaim a neglected American tradition.<br><br>The Puritan sermons with which the volume opens are extraordinary in their richness of imagery, force of argument, and probing psychological insight. From John Winthrop&#x2019;s visionary injunction that &#x201c;wee must consider that wee shall be as a citty upon a Hill,&#x201d; to Samuel Danforth&#x2019;s admonition not to deviate from the divine &#x201c;errand into the wilderness,&#x201d; these seventeenth-century works first explored what it means to be an American.<br><br>Jonathan Edwards&#x2019;s remarkable &#x201c;Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,&#x201d; which stirred its eighteenth-century audiences to frenzy, shows the intensity to which the sermon could rise, while Jonathan Mayhew&#x2019;s &#x201c;Discourse Concerning Unlimited Submission&#x201d; heralds the political thinking that led to the American Revolution.<br><br>The ferment of the nineteenth century&#x2014;the Mexican War, the struggle against slavery, the Civil War&#x2014;inevitably affected the sermon. Orthodoxies were challenged, and a new diversity emerged in the Unitarianism of William Ellery Channing, the Transcendentalism of Ralph Waldo Emerson, the new Church of Latter Day Saints, and the gathering strength of the African-American sermon tradition.<br><br>The twentieth-century sermons collected here continue to wrestle with fundamental spiritual and civic concerns. They range from a homily on charity by the popular evangelist Billy Sunday to a discourse on interfaith cooperation by Abraham Joshua Heschel, and from Harry Emerson Fosdick&#x2019;s controversial &#x201c;Shall the Fundamentalists Win?&#x201d; to John Gresham Machen&#x2019;s uncompromising riposte. The achievement of the African-American sermon attains a new breadth of influence in the inspiring oratory of Martin Luther King Jr.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing. The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries.</p><p>Whether it take the form of the formal prose of the Puritans, the clear, plain-spoken wisdom of the Quakers, or the improvisational style of African American folk preaching, the sermon is one of America's most unique types of literature. While this collection should never be considered easy reading, its high quality and profundity more than compensate for its challenges. In fact, this collection (spanning the 17th through the 20th centuries) is packed with literary and historical gems. Absalom Jones, an African Episcopal minister, preaches a heart-wrenching sermon that sings the praises of the end of the slave trade in 1808. Ralph Waldo Emerson delivers "The Lord's Supper Sermon," and, of course, there's Martin Luther King's most famous sermon, "I've Been to the Mountaintop."<p> <i>Newsweek</i> magazine called this "the most important book-publishing project in the nation's history." This may be an exaggeration; nonetheless the book is certainly a worthy project, if only for its recognition of the sermon as a legitimate and stirring genre of American literature. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>Michael Warner is professor of English at Rutgers University.

The chapters contain short biographical sketches of the scholars that illuminate their personal and academic lives, followed by summaries and evaluations of their major works, and concluding with an analysis of the ongoing relevance of their work in contemporary Johannine scholarship.<br><br>Key thinkers surveyed include C. H. Dodd, Rudolph Bultmann, Raymond Brown, Leon Morris, and R. Alan Culpepper. An introduction and conclusion by general editors Stanley Porter and Ron Fay trace the development of Johannine scholarship from F. C. Baur to the present, and examine how these eight scholars' contributions to Johannine studies have shaped the field. Anyone interested in the recent history of the study of John will find this volume indispensable.</p><p>Stanley E. Porter is president, dean, professor of New Testament, and Roy A. Hope Chair in Christian Worldview at McMaster Divinity College in Hamilton, Ontario.&#x201c;<i>The Gospel of John in Modern Interpretation</i> is a wonderful introduction to the fascinating world that is the New Testament study of John&#x2019;s gospel. Tracing the general history of the gospel&#x2019;s treatment, and focusing on the contribution of several key scholars, this book also traces the discussions that drive the gospel&#x2019;s study and how best to read it. The gospel of John has been an outlier in Jesus studies. This work explains why that should not be so, and what one must pay attention to in reading this crucial gospel. It is well worth a careful read.&#x201d; (Darrell L. Bock, Senior Research Professor of New Testament Studies, Dallas Theological Seminary 2018-06-28)<br><br>&#x201c;This is a very worthwhile volume, because instead of viewing &#x2018;modern interpretation&#x2019; as an abstraction, it looks at eight, carefully chosen modern <i>interpreters</i>, with their whole careers and scholarly contributions in view&#x2015;not merely their work on John&#x2019;s gospel. Three of them (Rudolf Bultmann, C.H. Dodd, and Raymond E. Brown) are obvious choices. Five others have been either half forgotten (B.F. Westcott), unfairly neglected or underappreciated (Adolf Schlatter and Leon Morris), dismissed as idiosyncratic (John A.T. Robinson), or pigeonholed as a &#x2018;mere&#x2019; literary critic (Alan Culpepper). They all deserve better, and this collection calls attention, once again, to their substantial contributions. A much needed and promising correction. Thank you, Stan Porter and Ron Fay and your authors!&#x201d; (J. Ramsey Michaels, Professor of Religious Studies Emeritus, Missouri State University, Springfield 2018-06-28)<br><br>&#x201c;In these valuable treatments of eight leading scholars over the last century or more, diverse approaches to the gospel of John in modern scholarship are here laid out in clear and helpful ways. Given the hugely diverse ways that top scholars have engaged and addressed John's notorious riddles (theological, historical, literary), a collection such as this provides interpreters a helpful guide in sorting out such subjects as John's authorship, composition, relation(s) to the Synoptics, situation, and meaning. New Testament readers and scholars alike are thus indebted to Stanley Porter and Ron Fay for gathering this fine collection, which shows that as much as some things change in biblical scholarship, many others remain the same." (Paul N. Anderson, Professor of Biblical and Quaker Studies, George Fox University 2018-06-28)<br><br>&#x201c;Here is an extremely well chosen collection of vignettes of major Johannine scholars from the late 1800s to the present. Not only do we learn of their contributions and significance, but we get a feel for their lives and social contexts. This is exemplary scholarship modeled in a fashion not quite paralleled anywhere else. If the series this volume inaugurates can continue this quality of offering, it will be of extraordinary value.&#x201d; (Craig L. Blomberg, Distinguished Professor of New Testament, Denver Seminary 2018-06-28)</p><h2>Testing the Current (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p>Growing up in a small upper Midwestern town in the late 1930s, young Tommy MacAllister is scarcely aware of the Depression, much less the rumblings of war in Europe. For his parents and their set, life seems to revolve around dinners and dancing at the country club, tennis dates and rounds of golf, holiday parties, summers on the Island, and sparkling occasions full of people and drinks and food and laughter. But curious as he is and impatient to grow up, Tommy will soon come to glimpse the darkness that lies beneath so much genteel complacency: hidden histories and embarrassing poor relations; the subtle (and not so subtle) slighting of the &#x201c;help&#x201d;; the mockery of President Roosevelt; and &#x201c;the commandment they talked least about in Sunday school,&#x201d; adultery.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>In <i>Testing the Current</i> William McPherson subtly sets off his wide-eyed protagonist&#x2019;s perspective with mature reflection and wry humor and surrounds him with a cast of vibrant characters, creating a scrupulously observed portrait of a place and time that will shimmer in readers&#x2019; minds long after the final page is turned.</p><p>William McPherson (b. 1933) is a Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning literary critic, editor, journalist, and novelist. Born and reared in Michigan, he attended three universities over the course of seven years but left before attaining a degree. After a stint in the Merchant Marine (he is still an able-bodied seaman), he started at <i>The Washington Post</i> as a copyboy in 1958, soon becoming a staff writer and editor. He spent several years as a senior editor at William Morrow &amp; Co. and returned to the <i>Post</i>, first as its daily book editor, then as founding editor of its independent book section, <i>Book World</i>. Later he moved to the newspaper&#x2019;s editorial page, where he selected the letters to the editor and wrote a weekly op-ed column. After a two-year leave of absence, he left the newspaper in 1987 to write full time. His first novel, <i>Testing the Current</i>, was originally published in 1984. A second, <i>To the Sargasso Sea</i>, published in 1987, took up the story of the first novel some thirty years later. In 1989 he went to Berlin as the Wall was coming down and ended up in Romania in early 1990, shortly after the fall of the Communist regime, intending to stay for three days. Instead, he spent most of the next six years there, writing about post-Communist Romania for <i>The Washington Post</i>, <i>Granta</i>, and <i>The Wilson Quarterly</i>.<br><br>D. T.

It is a novel written with great skill, and with love. It&#x2019;s what most good first novels aspire to be.&#x201d; &#x2014;Russell Banks, <i>The New York Times</i><br></p><h2>Essays on Astrology</h2><p>Here at last are the collected essays of the world&#39;s leading astrologer. In one comprehensive volume, Essays on Astrology makes a cross section of Robert Hand&#39;s writings available to both the beginning and advanced astrologer. Robert Hand is one of the few astrologers to successfully work and publish in both the technical and humanistic dimensions of astrology. Because of this, his work is read, reread and respected by all serious astrologers. And this book presents a comprehensive look at the various essays of this very important author. As a reference book, Essays on Astrology is an invaluable resource. Some articles written several years ago, such as The Ascendant, Midheaven and Vertex in Extreme Latitudes, have been extremely hard to find. Still others are printed here for the very first time making this not only a reprint of Robert Hand&#39;s previous works, but an important addition to the study of astrology.</p><p></p><h2>William Stringfellow: Essential Writings (Modern Spiritual Masters)</h2><p>William Stringfellow (1928-1985) was a radical lay theologian and social critic.

Three news vans. And one coroner&#x2019;s wagon.</p><p>Jenna Barton saw them as she made the turn onto the last county lane. The vehicles were fanned out around the old weathered barn, one wall collapsing in and the others hanging on for dear life.</p><p>The fields around her on either side, stretching away for miles to the edges of the county, were empty and barren, still marked by patches of snow from an uncharacteristically heavy storm for that part of Kentucky. The soil was dark and lumpy, the remnants of cornstalks sticking out like spikes.</p><p>As she came closer, the dirt and gravel on the narrow road pinging against the underside of her car, she saw the people as well. County sheriffs in their pale green uniforms and Smokey Bear hats. News reporters in their nice clothes and perfect hair were being followed by cameramen in flannel shirts and heavy boots. And a scattering of onlookers, the curious good old boys who heard the call on their scanners or read about it on Twitter, standing around in their feed caps, hands thrust deep into pockets against the cold, hoping for a glimpse of something horrific. Something gory or gross, some story they could tell later that night in the Downtowner while they sipped beers or threw darts.</p><p>Yeah, they&#x2019;d say, their bravado mostly covering their unease, I saw them bring the body out. Wasn&#x2019;t hardly anything left.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Jenna parked next to a sheriff&#x2019;s cruiser, but she didn&#x2019;t get out. She sat in the car, hands clenching the wheel, and took a few deep breaths. She told herself this was probably nothing, another false alarm, one of many she had experienced over the past three months. Every time an unidentified woman&#x2019;s body was found in central Kentucky, along an interstate or in a culvert, an abandoned house or the woods, someone called her. Usually the media but sometimes the police, and Jenna would have to wait it out, wondering whether this would be the time they&#x2019;d tell her they&#x2019;d found Celia. As she sat in the car, her eyes closed, the heater making the cabin of her Civic feel even closer and more cramped than it already was, she wondered whether she wanted to know the truth or if she could she keep her eyes shut and hide forever. Would she finally feel relief when they found her best friend&#x2019;s body?</p><p>The thoughts swirled through her brain like some twisted Zen koan:</p><p>I want to know.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t want to know.</p><p>A light tapping against the window brought her eyes open. Jenna blinked a few times, turned her head. She saw a smiling face, one wearing a pound of makeup and a wide smile. Becky McGee from Local 40 News. Becky gave a short wave, her shoulders rising in anticipation of Jenna&#x2019;s response.</p><p>Jenna turned the car off and stepped out. She&#x2019;d been at work when Becky called and still wore her light blue scrubs. She&#x2019;d rushed out of the office so fast she barely had time to grab her keys and purse. A damp winter chill hit Jenna as she straightened up, so she pulled her coat tighter, felt the light sting of the wind against her cheeks.</p><p>Becky placed her hand gently on Jenna&#x2019;s upper arm. &#x201c;How are you?&#x201d; she asked, her voice cooing as if she were talking to an invalid or a frightened child. &#x201c;Tough day, huh?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is it her?&#x201d; Jenna asked.</p><p>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t know anything,&#x201d; Becky said. &#x201c;Or they won&#x2019;t tell us anything. They&#x2019;ve been poking around in there for the last thirty minutes. It&#x2019;s a potential crime scene, so they have to take their time.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Becky&#x2019;s voice trailed off as Jenna&#x2019;s eyes wandered to the old barn. Some cops stood at the opening where a door once hung, staring inside. One of them said something and then smiled, looking to the man next to him for a laugh as well. They were close to fifty feet away from Jenna, so she couldn&#x2019;t hear them, and she envied their ease at the scene, their lack of emotional involvement in the outcome of the search. She looked around. She was the only one truly invested, the only one who would buckle with pain if Celia&#x2019;s body was discovered in the shitty, run-down barn.</p><p>Jenna turned back to Becky. The camera guy, Stan, loomed behind her, the equipment in his hand but not shooting. Jenna had learned over the past few months what the red light meant. &#x201c;What did they find?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;You said on the phone it was a body.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s&#x2014;&#x201d; The cheer and lilt quickly went out of Becky&#x2019;s voice. She was a little older than Jenna, probably in her early forties, but her voice still sounded like the high school cheerleader she had once been. &#x201c;Bones. I guess, a bone to be more specific.&#x201d; Becky nodded, confirming the fact. &#x201c;Yes, they found a bone. A surveying crew was out here, and they went looking inside the barn to get out of the cold or to take a smoke break, and they found a leg bone. Now they&#x2019;re digging around in there, looking for more.&#x201d; Becky made an exaggerated frown to show how awful she found the whole situation.</p><p>&#x201c;Did someone call Ian?&#x201d; Jenna asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I did. He said he wasn&#x2019;t going to come. You know he never makes it out to anything like this.&#x201d; Becky lowered her voice. &#x201c;I think he mistrusts any potential display of emotion. Plus, you know, a lot of people still think he&#x2019;s guilty.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The police cleared him,&#x201d; Jenna said.</p><p>&#x201c;Mostly,&#x201d; Becky said, her voice low.</p><p>Jenna wished she could be as strong as Ian, could so easily and readily draw lines and never cross them. It was easier for men. People accepted it if a man was cold and distant. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s smarter than me, I guess. It&#x2019;s so cold out here.&#x201d;</p><p>Jenna saw the other reporters and their cameramen moving her way. They recognized her, of course, after all the stories and interviews, after all the features and updates on Celia&#x2019;s case. They knew she was good for a quote or two, knew the viewers loved to hear from her, even the ones who took to online forums and social media to criticize her. It was Jenna whom Celia was leaving the house to see that night back in November. It was Jenna who first called Ian when Celia didn&#x2019;t arrive at their designated meeting place. It was Jenna, Celia&#x2019;s best friend since high school, who could tell the viewers anything they wanted to know about Celia.</p><p>Jenna knew the reporters were using her, but she couldn&#x2019;t help herself. She felt obligated to speak to them out of loyalty to Celia, even though she always received crank calls&#x2014;at work and at home&#x2014;and hateful comments on Twitter and Facebook. People offered support too, plenty of people, she reminded herself. But the nasty ones stuck with her.</p><p>Becky nodded to Stan, easing toward Jenna, reaching out with one hand to brush something off her coat. &#x201c;You know what would be great? We&#x2019;d love to be able to get your reaction now, you know, and have it as part of the story tonight. And I&#x2019;ve already heard from New York. Reena wants to do a live remote tonight, put it all over CNN. Of course she&#x2019;d love to have you again. She thinks you&#x2019;re great.&#x201d; Becky tilted her head to one side, studying Jenna. &#x201c;This is so cool that you wore your work uniform. It&#x2019;s so real. If you could slip your coat off and&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Please, Becky.&#x201d; She didn&#x2019;t want to be rude, didn&#x2019;t want to snap at the reporter who Jenna knew was only doing her job and who had always been decent to her. Jenna tried to soften her words with a smile, but it felt forced, like squeezing toothpaste back into a tube. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s cold out here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You want the coat on?&#x201d; Becky asked. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s fine. It&#x2019;s a little brisk, even for February.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, I don&#x2019;t want to talk right now,&#x201d; Jenna said, her voice friendly but firm. &#x201c;Not before.&#x201d;</p><p>Becky was a professional, but that didn&#x2019;t mean she could hide all her emotions. One side of her mouth crinkled when Jenna told her no, and a glossy coldness passed over her eyes. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want to talk now?&#x201d; Becky&#x2019;s eyes darted around. She scooted closer, lowering her voice and adding a steely edge. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going to talk to someone else, are you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to talk to another reporter, no. Of course not.&#x201d; Jenna sighed. &#x201c;Whatever happens, I&#x2019;ll talk to you first.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good. Because you and I&#x2014;&#x201d; Becky&#x2019;s glance darted to the other reporters who stood just out of earshot. She eyed them like a school of circling sharks, which in a way they were. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve always had a rapport, ever since this happened. And with Reena in New York helping me&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;After,&#x201d; Jenna said. &#x201c;Okay? Let&#x2019;s just talk after.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;After what?&#x201d; Becky asked.</p><p>&#x201c;After we find out what&#x2019;s&#x2014;who&#x2019;s&#x2014;really in that barn.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d; Becky asked. She lowered her voice again. &#x201c;You know it could take a while for them to identify anything. I mean, they have to use the dental records at this point. And you always have something interesting to say. And this whole town has been on edge for the past few months. Things like this don&#x2019;t happen here.&#x201d;</p><p>Jenna felt the heat rise in her cheeks, and as it did, the molars at the back of her mouth ground together like shifting tectonic plates. She didn&#x2019;t want to say the wrong thing. She had a tendency to do that, to blurt things out. The wrong things at the wrong times. Jokes at a funeral, curses in front of someone&#x2019;s grandmother. They never came out the way she intended, and sometimes she hurt people or offended them. She never seemed to know how her words would land, and she wished she could learn to keep her mouth shut.</p><p>But Becky read the look and nodded, reaching up to pat her hair. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; she said, smiling, doing her best to set Jenna&#x2019;s mind at ease. &#x201c;After will be better.&#x201d;</p><p>Better, Jenna thought. Better? Would any of this ever be better?</p><p></p><br><p>Chapter Two</p><p>It was a first for Jared Barton: a beautiful girl in his bedroom.</p><p>Yes, he&#x2019;d fooled around with girls before. At parties or in the park, fumbling in the dark, the sweet taste of some kind of flavored vodka on the girl&#x2019;s breath while they kissed, their tongues swirling like clothes in a dryer. And he remembered the ever-present fear of interruptions that hung over those encounters: other kids barging into the bedroom or, worst of all, police chasing them from the park, the flashlight blast in the eyes, the smug cops hustling them away with smirks on their faces. Okay, Romeo, the park&#x2019;s closed now.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>But even though his mom worked full-time and his dad was long gone, Jared had never managed to bring a girl home. At fifteen, he felt a little behind. He had friends at school who boasted of blow jobs and even sex, and Jared listened to the stories in awe, not saying much for fear of betraying the fact that he&#x2019;d never made it past second base, a private shame he kept to himself. But here she was, standing in his room after school on a Tuesday afternoon, the amazing Tabitha Burke.</p><p>Jared told himself to remain calm and to not&#x2014;for the love of all that was holy&#x2014;blow this chance.</p><p>Tabitha leaned over his desk, her long fingers picking up items and then placing them down, almost as though she was shopping in a store and didn&#x2019;t know what she wanted to buy. When they&#x2019;d come in, Jared silently thanked whatever god dwelled above that his room was relatively clean, that there were no dirty boxer shorts on the floor, no stained socks or wet bath towels littering the carpet. For once he was glad his mom rode his ass about keeping things clean. He wanted to make the best impression possible, and he didn&#x2019;t think Tabitha would be the kind of girl who would leave dirty clothes on the floor or dirty dishes on her desk. Not that he&#x2019;d ever been close to her house, let alone inside.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you want a drink or something?&#x201d; Jared asked. &#x201c;I think we have some Cokes. Maybe my mom made iced tea.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; Tabitha said. She looked back at him, offering a smile that revealed a dimple on her left cheek.</p><p>Jared loved the smile&#x2014;even though her teeth weren&#x2019;t perfectly straight&#x2014;and he loved the dimple. He liked to caress her cheeks when they were close, making out and kissing her lips, her ears, her neck, running his fingers over her soft skin because he&#x2019;d never felt anything like it. But that answer to his question about the drink. I&#x2019;m fine. Tabitha said it all the time about almost everything. He thought of it as her motto, her catch-all response to most questions, and Jared couldn&#x2019;t help thinking of it as a line in the sand, something that always reminded him he&#x2019;d know her some, but not as much as he wanted. He hoped&#x2014;and kept hoping&#x2014;that would change, that he&#x2019;d hear that phrase less and less as time went by.</p><p>He&#x2019;d only met her three weeks earlier on the icy January day she showed up at Brereton Jones High School in Hawks Mill, Kentucky. The semester had already started and, in homeroom that first day, Tabitha was escorted in by a guidance counselor. She carried no backpack or pens, no papers or books, and she looked tired, like someone who&#x2019;d just come off a twelve-hour shift in a factory. Jared didn&#x2019;t care. Tired or not, Tabitha was beautiful: almost as tall as he was with fair freckled skin and green eyes. Her hair looked a little greasy that day, and she wore it back, but that only called more attention to her full lips, which Jared stared at while Tabitha explained to another girl that she&#x2019;d just moved to Hawks Mill from Florida. They&#x2019;d driven all night, she said, she and her dad. He&#x2019;d just started a new job in town.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>But Jared didn&#x2019;t care about the details. He wanted to&#x2014;needed to&#x2014;meet her. He wasn&#x2019;t sure he&#x2019;d ever wanted anything&#x2014;anyone&#x2014;so much in his life. It felt like hunger, a physical craving.</p><p>And he did meet her that very first day during sixth period. Jared went to the library instead of the cafeteria where he normally spent his study halls, goofing around with his friends, drinking Cokes and watching stupid videos on their phones. But he knew he had a math quiz that day, and he knew if he went to the cafeteria he&#x2019;d fail.</p><p>He hadn&#x2019;t stopped thinking about Tabitha since seeing her in homeroom. He&#x2019;d spent the whole day hoping she&#x2019;d end up in another one of his classes, and short of that, he hoped for a glimpse of her in the hallway. But those things didn&#x2019;t happen, so when he walked into the library and saw her sitting alone at a table, reading&#x2014;of all things&#x2014;a book by Dean Koontz, his heart raced like a motorboat.</p><p>She liked Dean Koontz. Jared loved Dean Koontz. And she just so happened to be reading one of Jared&#x2019;s favorites: Whispers.</p><p>Jared didn&#x2019;t stop. He didn&#x2019;t open his math book, and he didn&#x2019;t sit at another table. He went right up to Tabitha and complimented her on her taste in books. He knew he was taking a risk, approaching the new, very pretty girl and striking up a conversation. Jared felt the same that day in the library as the time he first went off the high dive at the community pool. He remembered the slow climb up the ladder, the terrifying view of the blue water on all sides. He knew kids were lined up behind him, and to turn away or back down meant instant humiliation.</p><p>So he jumped.</p><p>And how good it felt&#x2014;the free fall through the air, the glorious splash into the water. The bubbles streaming from his mouth as he sank, and then the steady rise back to daylight. The terror and the glory.</p><p>He jumped with Tabitha too. He didn&#x2019;t think, didn&#x2019;t turn around and walk away.</p><p>He...</p></p><h2>One Time, One Place: Mississippi in the Depression: A Snapshot Album</h2><p><br>Eudora Welty is among the very few authors who are acclaimed for their work in both literature and photography.

She lives in Asheville, North Carolina.</p><p>SMALL-BATCH BAKING FOR CHOCOLATE LOVERS (Chapter One)Small-Batch Chocolate Baking Know-How</p><p>What You Need to Get Started&#x2014;Equipment, Ingredients and Measuring Techniques, and Storing Ingredients</p><p>Many people have remarked to me, since the first Small-Batch Baking book, that baking is a scientific process. Well, in fact, it is but it need not be dauntingly so. True, I did graduate from Virginia Tech with a BS in home economics and had to take several chemistry courses along with the food-related; some of that knowledge from long ago nagged at me while I worked with these recipes. But what has turned me into a baker is the experimenting I have done over the years&#x2014;the successes and the failures have added to that basic knowledge and have given me a &#x201c;feel&#x201d; for baking. Believe me, my grandmother did not take as many science courses as I did, and she was one fabulous baker. All you need to learn is a willingness to practice.</p><p>This book can give you a lot of practice, because you can bake almost every day and still not overindulge. You can hone your baking skills and not eat too much of a good thing. Following the guidelines of moderation and portion control as you treat yourself is the ultimate &#x201c;having your cake and eating it all, too.&#x201d;</p><p>Most methods I describe in Small-Batch Baking for Chocolate Lovers are the same as one would use for baking large batches, i.e., you mix cookie dough the same way except in a smaller bowl with less ingredients. But it is not always possible to divide a standard recipe by halves, thirds, or quarters and arrive at the same flavor and texture. So the recipe ingredients are specifically tailored to baking small batches, and they will result in the quality of baked goods you expect from its traditional counterpart. The formulas I have worked out and the clear instructions on manipulating them will give you success and confidence in your baking skills.</p><p>Equipment</p><p>Since the original Small-Batch Baking was published in 2005, many manufacturers have come out with smaller pans tailored to baking in miniature. And while those can be fun and efficient, honestly, you can most likely use what is already in your kitchen. I love to recycle 8-ounce and 14- to 15-ounce cans from standard pantry items&#x2014;like water chestnuts and tomatoes&#x2014;for baking; they are perfectly safe to use in the oven.</p><p>For muffins and small cakes, 6-cup muffin pans with standard-and jumbo-size cups are easily found in supermarkets, kitchen shops, home goods stores, and online. Petite loaf pans, with a 2-cup capacity, are the perfect size for baking loaf breads and cakes. For tarts, I like to use 4�-inch-diameter tart pans with removable bottoms; the 4-inch-diameter tart pans are also good for baking individual pies. Both sizes have removable bottoms for easier serving. And, actually, you can make pies in jumbo muffin cups; look through the section on muffin pans to see how to do it.</p><p>At the beginning of this book&#x2019;s testing phase, I bought an inexpensive set of toaster oven baking equipment that included a small wire rack, baking sheet, and baking pan. Those three items were the things I used most in the kitchen: the rack for cooling and the baking sheet for cookies and cradling cake cans and tart pans. The baking pan was just right for cheesecakes and puddings that needed a water bath. You can find these pan sets at home goods stores and discount superstores.</p><p>Here is a basic equipment list for other items you will need for mixing batter or dough and baking it.</p><p>The small-batch bowl. The right size for creaming butter and sugar, mixing cookie or cake batter, beating egg whites, and whipping cream is a 1�-quart bowl that is taller than it is wide. I have a collection that began with the mixing bowl that came with my mother&#x2019;s first stand mixer; it measures 6 inches in diameter on the top and about 3 inches in diameter on the bottom. My most recent purchase is an OXO bowl with a nonstick outer surface; its diameter is 1 inch larger than the other one, but still proportionally perfect for rounding up the small amounts of ingredients. If the bowl is too large, shallow, and wide at the top, the small amounts of ingredients tend to fly up and around the bowl instead of collecting in the center. All-Clad makes a good-quality bowl with a handle; both brands, and others, are available at kitchen supply stores, home goods stores, discount superstores, and online.</p><p>Handheld mixer. Being able to control the direction of the mixer coupled with the capability of mixing at lower speeds makes the handheld mixer a more efficient choice than a stand mixer fitted with the small bowl. It works much better for creaming a few tablespoons of butter and sugar, lightening � cup of batter, and beating 1 egg white or � cup cream.</p><p>Rubber spatulas. Every little bit of an ingredient counts when you work with small batches, and a rubber spatula is the best tool for scraping out every smidgeon of melted chocolate into a batter or frosting, all of the batter into the prepared cans, or the last morsel of cookie dough to make that final cookie. An assortment of wide-to-narrow spatulas will make sure you have one for every need and task.</p><p>Muffin pans. A jumbo muffin pan, with six �-cup-capacity cups, is just right for baking large bakery-style muffins, single-serving small cakes, quick breads, and even deep-dish pies. If you use them for pies, line the cups with aluminum foil and butter the foil so you can remove the pie from the pan more easily. A regular-size muffin pan, with six �-cup-capacity cups, is great for baking individual smaller muffins and cupcakes.</p><p>Petite loaf pans. These measure 5 � 3 inches and hold 2 cups of batter; they are the right size for baking small loaves of quick breads, cakes, brownies, and bar cookies that serve two or three. Supermarkets, discount superstores, and kitchen shops carry them.</p><p>Loaf pans. Cake rolls, or roulades, are baked in 9 � 5-inch loaf pans. In a perfect world, there would be a jelly-roll pan with those dimensions and 1-inch-high sides, but the 3-inch-high larger loaf pan is a fitting substitute. When you line the loaf pan with parchment and use the paper to lift the cake layer from the pan, it rolls beautifully over a filling. It cuts crosswise into three neat slices that look like you cut them from a long, traditional cake roll.</p><p>Individual tart pans with removable bottoms. Having pairs of both the 4 � 13/8-inch and the 4� � �-inch tart pans is helpful with this cookbook. The 4-inch is just the right size for making fluted crust, deep-dish pies; they will come out easily from the pan if you coat the inside of the tart pan with cooking spray before baking the crust. The wider tart pans are good to use when the filling is somewhat richer in flavor and you want a thinner layer of it.</p><p>Recycled cans. This is my favorite recycling act: saving cans to bake in. Taller, two-layer cakes can be baked in 14.5- to 15-ounce cans, and single layer cakes and cheesecakes can be baked in 8-ounce cans. So save your tomato and bean and water chestnut cans or others of the same size that do not have pop tops.<br> You need to be able to cut the tops off an empty can with a &#x201c;clean-cut&#x201d; can opener, completely removing the entire top from the now-rounded edges of the can (which forms as the can opener does its work). Remove the can&#x2019;s label, and run the can through the dishwasher or wash it by hand thoroughly. Use cans that have no dents or nicks; the baked cakes will not show ridges from the sides of the cans, but dented cans will bake misshapen cakes and they may not slide as easily out of the cans.<br> To prepare the cans for baking, lightly butter the insides of the cans and dust them with flour, tapping out the excess. For easy greasing, use a basting brush and a little melted butter to brush and coat the insides of the cans without having to reach with your hand into the bottom of the cans to butter them. Or coat them lightly with baking spray. Place the cans on a piece of parchment paper and trace around the circumference. Cut out circles of parchment paper to line the bottoms. The cakes will invert right out of the cans, just like they would come out of cake pans.<br> When you fill the cans for baking layer cakes, the batter will only reach about one-third of the way up the sides of the cans. As they bake, they rise only about one-half to two-thirds of the way up the sides of the cans. When you remove the cakes from the cans and fill and frost them, they will be the perfect sizes for individual servings.<br> After testing the cakes for doneness with a toothpick, cool the cakes for 10 minutes on a wire rack, then run the tip of a narrow, sharp knife around the edges of the cakes, holding the cans with a cloth to protect your hands. The cakes will slip out easily; remove the parchment paper liners and cool them upright.<br> Discard the cans if you see any discoloration, otherwise they can be re-used for another baking adventure. If there is any question about their condition, put them in your recycling bin. After all, they are a cinch to replace.</p><p>Can opener. To bake in cans, a &#x201c;clean-cut&#x201d; can opener is a must. This is one that cuts off the tops of the cans without leaving any jagged edges to tear the cakes as they are unmolded, or that will nick your hands as you prepare the cans for baking. Most sturdy crank and electric can openers perform this task, but throw out your old, dull, rusty hand-crank can opener if it does not smooth the edges as it cuts.</p><p>Single-serving ovenproof bowl. These include souffl� dishes, custard cups, ramekins, and even ovenproof single-serve bowls for baking puddings and souffl�s.</p><p>Ingredients And Measuring Techniques</p><p>You can easily cut a stir-fry down to size by dividing the ingredients into halves or fourths, but you can&#x2019;t tinker with baking in the same manner and expect wonderful results. When reducing a baking recipe, leavening ingredients, such as eggs, baking powder, and baking soda, do not reduce pro...</p></p><h2>Indecent Exposure: The Academy (The Academy, 2)</h2><p><p><strong>One of Amazon's Best Romances of February</strong></p><p><strong>One of Bookpage's Best Romances of 2018</strong></p><p><strong>"Sexy and emotional..."

The day after high school graduation, she packed her yearbook, ripped jeans, and laptop, and drove cross-country to New York City in under four days. Her most valuable life experiences were learned thereafter while waitressing at K-Dees, a Manhattan pub owned by her uncle. Inside those four walls, she met her husband, best friend, and discovered the magic of classic rock, managing to put herself through Kingsborough Community College and the English program at Pace University at the same time. Several stunted attempts to enter the work force as a journalist followed, but romance writing continued to demand her attention.<br><br>She now lives in Long Island, New York with her husband and daughter.

"You gotta want to be a cowboy." Mack Hughes wanted to be a cowboy, all right, and he was just twelve years old when he went to work for the famous Hashknife spread in northern Arizona. Growing up on the range, Mack lived a life about which modern boys can only wonder. He spins yarns of bad horses and the men who rode them, tells of wild dogs that ravaged young calves, and recalls lonely winter weeks spent at a remote camp-where his home was a shack so flimsy that snow blew through the cracks and covered his bed.<br><br> Stella Hughes, author of the best-selling <i>Chuck Wagon Cookin'</i> and a cowhand in her own right, has compiled from her husband's reminiscences an authentic look both at Arizona history and at cowboying as it really was.

In addition to his novels, Kelton worked as an agricultural journalist for forty-two years, and served in the infantry in World War II. He passed away in 2009.<p>CHAPTER 1 <br>Cletus Slocum stole Donley Bannister&#x2019;s best horse and crippled it. Now Slocum lay facedown in the dirt, as dead as he would ever be. <br>Bannister was known locally as a horse trader, .nding them in faraway places and bringing them to the West Texas hill country for sale. He could recognize a good horse as far as he could see it, and spot a blemish from .fty yards. He loved horses as other men might love a woman. The blue roan, he thought, was one of the best he had ever owned. <br>The four Slocum brothers&#x2014; three now that Cletus was gone&#x2014; also had a reputation for knowing good horses, stealing them when and where they could. They had gone unpunished because law of.cers had not been able to bring a strong case to court. It was dif.cult to persuade a witness to testify against one of them, knowing that to do so was to invite an unfriendly visit by the other three. <br>Bannister did not wait for the law to act. He pursued Cletus across the rockiest ground along the South Llano River. He caught up with him when the roan stumbled and went down, breaking a foreleg. While witness Willy Pegg trembled and begged for his own life, Bannister put an end to Cletus&#x2019;s dubious career. He felt no remorse over the man, but his heart was heavy with pain when he shot the crippled roan. <br>Riding back to Junction, he stopped at a modest frame house he shared with his wife Geneva. While he hastily gathered a few necessities for travel, he told her, &#x201c;I just killed Cletus Slocum. It was a fair .ght. You stay put here till I come back. Don&#x2019;t try to follow me.&#x201d; <br>Thoughtfully, he left her some money. Not so thoughtfully, he neglected to kiss her good- bye before he rode away. Afterward, though she often thought about that oversight, he never did. <br>Andy Pickard stood in the open boxcar door, feeling through his boots the rumble of steel wheels against the rails. Wisps of coal smoke burned his eyes as he watched West Texas hills roll by at more than thirty miles an hour. He wished he were heading home. Instead, the train was carry ing him farther and farther from his new wife. <br>He sometimes wondered why he had decided to rejoin the Texas Rangers. There were less stressful ways to make a living. He had had more than enough of farming, walking all day behind a plow and a mule, taking verbal abuse from a cranky brother- in- law. He wanted to raise livestock, for that was something he could do on horse back, but a decent start in ranching required money. He did not yet have enough. Rangering seemed his best option for now. He regretted that it often took him too far and kept him too long away from Bethel. <br>He turned to a stall where his black horse stood tied, feet braced against the pull of the train&#x2019;s forward motion. He said, &#x201c;At least you&#x2019;re gettin&#x2019; to ride most of the way. Bannister&#x2019;s horse had to take it all on foot.&#x201d; <br>The Ranger of.ce in Fort Worth had received a wire saying that Donley Bannister was seen in the West Texas railroad town of Colorado City. Andy happened to be in Fort Worth to deliver a prisoner. He had been dispatched to apprehend Bannister and bring him back to stand trial for shooting Cletus Slocum. <br>At least the disagreement had been about something worthwhile, Andy thought. Too many men had been killed quarreling over such trivial matters as whiskey, cards, or dance hall girls. A horse was a different matter. A good horse might well justify a righ teous killing. <br>Extension of rails across the state had given Ranger ef.ciency a strong boost in these early 1880s. No matter how fast he traveled, a fugitive could not outrun the telegraph, and now he had to contend with the railroad as well. Rangers could put their horses on a train and cover distances in hours that would otherwise keep them in the saddle for days. They could move ahead of a .eeing suspect and cut him off or at least rush to wherever he had last been seen and shorten his lead. That was Andy&#x2019;s mission on this trip. <br>To the best of his knowledge, he had never seen Bannister. He had a physical description of the man, however, in the handwritten fugitive book he carried in his pocket: tall, husky, with pale gray eyes and a small scar on his left cheekbone where a mule had once kicked him. Probably a bit crazy too. A kick in the head could do that to a man, and nothing could kick harder than a mule. <br>The train chugged to a stop at a siding beside a tower upon which stood a large wooden water tank. Andy climbed down to stretch his aching legs and beheld the largest windmill he had ever seen. He judged its wheel to be twenty feet across, maybe twenty- .ve. Locomotive boilers required a lot of water to produce steam. The windmill, vital to the railroads, had also done much to open up large areas of West Texas for settlement by farmers and ranchers. They provided water where nature had neglected to do so. <br>He had recently placed a smaller mill over a hand- dug well on acreage he had bought in the hill country west of San Antonio. Someday, when he had saved enough, he planned to resign from the Rangers again, build a house beside the windmill and move there with Bethel. It was a good grass country for cattle, and several people had brought in sheep. Andy had no prejudice against woolies. They seemed to thrive so long as their own er could .ght off the wolves and coyotes and bobcats. These had a strong taste for lambs. <br>The thought of Bethel brought both warmth and pain. Stationed in a Ranger camp near a former army post town, Fort McKavett, he had rented a small house at the edge of the settlement. There she was able to grow a garden and raise chickens. He had spent nights with her when he was not away on duty. He realized this was not the customary way for a young couple to begin married life. Too often he had to kiss her good- bye and ride away without knowing when he might return. Looking back, which he always did, he would see her small .gure standing there, waving, watching him until he was beyond sight. <br>He had warned her at the beginning that as a Ranger&#x2019;s wife she would spend many days and nights alone, waiting, wishing. But he wondered if she had fully understood how often she would have only a .ock of chickens and a brown dog for company. He even wondered if he should have put off marriage until he could provide her with a more stable home. But both had waited a long time already, almost beyond endurance. <br>He hoped he could capture the fugitive quickly and get back to her. A dispatch had indicated that Bannister could probably make a strong case for self- defense if he had stayed in Junction and faced trial. But he had chosen to run, so he was playing hell with Andy&#x2019;s married life. <br>The train&#x2019;s black- uniformed conductor walked down the line after seeing that the boiler was properly .lled. Pulling out his pocket watch and checking the time, he said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be pullin&#x2019; out in a couple of minutes, Ranger. Ought to be in Colorado City in an hour.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; Andy said. &#x201c;The sooner there, the sooner I can get my business done and go home.&#x201d; <br>The conductor gave him a quizzical smile. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bet you&#x2019;ve got a young wife waitin&#x2019; for you. That&#x2019;d account for your constipated look.&#x201d; <br>Andy&#x2019;s face warmed. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know it showed.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I know the signs from personal experience. Seems like I&#x2019;ve been married since I was six years old.&#x201d; <br>Andy asked, &#x201c;How do you handle it, bein&#x2019; away from home so much?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Home these days is what ever train I happen to be on.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t miss bein&#x2019; with your wife?&#x201d; <br>Thoughtfully the conductor said, &#x201c;Son, the .re burns hot when you .rst get married, but then it cools down. There&#x2019;s times you start feelin&#x2019; crowded. You look for a reason to get away for a while, and she&#x2019;s just as anxious to be shed of you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It won&#x2019;t be that way for me and Bethel.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It will. Nature works it out like that to keep married couples from killin&#x2019; one another.&#x201d; The conductor frowned. &#x201c;You ain&#x2019;t told me, but I suspect you&#x2019;re after a man. Is he dangerous?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I just know that he&#x2019;s charged with murder.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Then he&#x2019;s dangerous. And you&#x2019;re .xin&#x2019; to tackle him by yourself?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s just one man.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;If I was you, and I had a young wife waitin&#x2019; for me, I&#x2019;d .nd a safer way to make a livin&#x2019;.&#x201d; <br>Bethel had not said much directly, but Andy had sensed that she felt as the conductor did. One of these days, when he could afford to buy more land and the livestock to put on it... <br>The train slowly picked up speed. Andy watched the telephone poles going by. A line had been strung alongside the tracks all the way from Fort Worth. It didn&#x2019;t seem logical to him that progress could advance much farther. Just about everything conceivable had already been invented. <br>Colorado City was mostly new, an offspring of the railroad as it had advanced westward. When the boxcar was centered in front of a loading chute, Andy led the black horse down the ramp to a water trough. A little Mexican packmule followed like a faithful dog. After both animals had drunk their .ll, Andy rode up the street toward the court house. It was customary for a Ranger to call upon local peace of.cers unless there was a reason not to, such as a suspicion that they were in league with the lawbreakers. That was not the case here. <br>Andy introduced himself to the sheriff, a middle- aged man with graying hair and an expanding waistline. The sheriff said, &#x201c;I got a call that you&#x2019;d be on the train. I thought they&#x2019;d send an older, more experienced man.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m old enough. What&#x2019;s the latest about Donley Bannister?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Nothin&#x2019; much more than what I wired your captain...</p></p><h2>Most Likely to Succeed: Preparing Our Kids for the Innovation Era</h2><p>From two leading experts in education and entrepreneurship, an urgent call for the radical re-imagining of American education so that we better equip students for the realities of the twenty-first century economy.<br><br>Today more than ever, we prize academic achievement, pressuring our children to get into the &#x201c;right&#x201d; colleges, have the highest GPAs, and pursue advanced degrees. But while students may graduate with credentials, by and large they lack the competencies needed to be thoughtful, engaged citizens and to get good jobs in our rapidly evolving economy. Our school system was engineered a century ago to produce a work force for a world that no longer exists. Alarmingly, our methods of schooling crush the creativity and initiative young people need to thrive in the twenty-first century.<br> <br>In <i>Most Likely to Succeed,</i> bestselling author and education expert Tony Wagner and venture capitalist Ted Dintersmith call for a complete overhaul of the function and focus of American schools, sharing insights and stories from the front lines, including profiles of successful students, teachers, parents, and business leaders.<br> <br><i>Most Likely to Succeed</i> presents a new vision of American education, one that puts wonder, creativity, and initiative at the very heart of the learning process and prepares students for today&#x2019;s economy. This book offers parents and educators a crucial guide to getting the best for their children and a roadmap for policymakers and opinion leaders.</p><p>Tony Wagner&nbsp;currently serves as an Expert In Residence at Harvard University's Innovation Lab. Previously he has worked as a high school teacher, K-8 principal, university professor, and founding executive director of Educators for Social Responsibility. Tony is a frequent speaker at national and international conferences and the author of <i>Creating Innovators</i> and <i>The Global Achievement Gap</i>.<br> Ted Dintersmith was one of the top-ranked venture capitalist in the U.S., and is now focused on issues at the intersection of innovation and education. &nbsp;He organized and produced the documentary Most Likely To Succeed, which premiered at Sundance, 2015. &nbsp;He was appointed to represent the U.S. at the United Nations General Assembly for the 2012 session, where he focused on global education issues.Most Likely to Succeed INTRODUCTION<p></p> <br>This book is a product of an unlikely collaboration that began with a breakfast in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on a snowy day in early 2012.<br> <br>We come from very different worlds. Tony Wagner has spent his career in the world of education. He taught English for more than a decade, ran a school, got a doctorate from Harvard&#x2019;s Graduate School of Education, started an education-related nonprofit, is a frequent keynote speaker at major conferences around the world, and has written five books on education. His body of work points the way toward a completely reimagined education system, one optimized for a world of innovation and the complexities of twenty-first-century citizenship. His two most recent books, The Global Achievement Gap and Creating Innovators, have sold almost a quarter of a million copies, received widespread critical acclaim, and have been translated into more than ten languages.<br> <br>Ted Dintersmith spent his career in the world of technology and innovation. He got his PhD in Engineering from Stanford and then ran a start-up making the semiconductors that helped enable the digital revolution. The majority of his career has been in the field of venture capital, as a senior partner with one of the nation&#x2019;s top-tier early-stage venture firms, Charles River Ventures. He&#x2019;s been on the board of directors of the National Venture Capital Association, championed their national competitiveness initiative, and was ranked by Business 2.0 as the top-performing venture capitalist in the United States during the period 1995&#x2013;1999.<br> <br>A few years ago, Ted began directing more of his focus toward education. As a father of two school-aged children, he was concerned by what he saw as a disconnect between schools and an increasingly innovative world. He knew that rapid advances in innovation were eliminating traditional jobs from the economy. Workers performing routinized tasks were becoming an endangered species. Companies wanted to hire creative problem-solvers able to continually invent ways to add value to their organizations, but found few of them graduating from our schools. Alarmingly, the schools he visited seemed intent on crushing the creativity out of students&#x2014;erasing the very skills that would have allowed them to thrive.<br> <br>Ted began meeting with education experts to learn more. These meetings were highly informative, but they often ended with, &#x201c;Well, the person you really need to meet is Tony Wagner.&#x201d; After reading Tony&#x2019;s books, Ted sent him a blind email, asking him to get together on one of Ted&#x2019;s upcoming trips to Boston. Tony agreed, and a one-hour breakfast turned into a three-hour discussion about how our obsolete education system was stymieing the innovation crucial to success in today&#x2019;s economy.<br> <br>By the end of the breakfast, the two of us found that, despite vast differences in professional backgrounds, we shared convictions that could be distilled to these points:<br> <br>�&nbsp;Rapid advances in innovation are eliminating structured routine jobs from our economy, leaving millions of young Americans at risk;<br> <br>�&nbsp;The critical skills young adults need in the twenty-first century for careers in the world of innovation, and for responsible citizenship, are the very skills the school years eviscerate;<br> <br>�&nbsp;The education policies our country is pursuing to &#x201c;fix&#x201d; schools only serve to harm students and disillusion teachers;<br> <br>�&nbsp;While education credentials were historically aligned with competencies that mattered, they have become prohibitively expensive, emotionally damaging, and disconnected from anything essential;<br> <br>�&nbsp;Unless we completely reimagine school, the growing divide between the haves and have-nots will threaten to rip civil society apart; and,<br> <br>�&nbsp;We have an urgent obligation to speak out, since we know what our education system needs to do to give every student a fighting chance in life.<br> <br>That initial three-hour breakfast conversation subsequently blossomed into a daily collaboration. The two of us have worked closely with award-winning documentarian Greg Whiteley on a feature-length film on education, Most Likely to Succeed, which premiered at the prestigious Sundance Film Festival in January 2015. The documentary has served as the foundation for a broad and ambitious initiative we are launching to help schools move forward. Together, the documentary, the outreach initiative, and this book provide a framework for reimagining school.<br> What Mattered to You<p></p> <br> <br>When we talk to people, we always find it revealing to inquire about their school experiences; we&#x2019;ve all been students. For starters, we thought it might help if we provide a bit of context on our own school experiences.<br> <br>Tony hated school, had average SATs, and went to two nondescript colleges before finally earning his BA degree at what was then one of the most experimental (but equally anonymous) undergraduate programs in the country. He went on to earn a Master of Arts in Teaching and a Doctorate in Education at Harvard University, where he found himself to be a complete outlier. While at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, Tony was almost constantly at odds with the mainstream of education, and he developed his views despite what was covered in classrooms. Tony is an example of someone who survived the education system and went on to have a successful career as an author, speaker, and consultant. And he&#x2019;ll be the first to admit that a doctorate from Harvard has a sort of &#x201c;Wizard of Oz&#x201d; benefit&#x2014;the credential is important largely because everyone thinks it&#x2019;s important.<br> <br>Ted has an innate ability to do simple math problems quickly. While this skill is of limited value in life, it was his best friend in school. He never missed a point on a standardized math test, and excelled at his math and physics courses. Only when he went to Stanford for graduate school did he realize that what is required to be a great physicist has almost nothing to do with what is required to be a great physics student. Fortunately for his career prospects, after earning an MS in Applied Physics and a PhD in Engineering from Stanford University, he switched out of physics into technology and innovation, where he experienced considerable success. He is now an active education philanthropist, providing guidance and funding to several high-potential organizations seeking to move education into the twenty-first century.<br> <br>The authors went to school in the 1960s and &#x2019;70s, a period that stands in stark contrast to today&#x2019;s pressure-packed school years. Back then, there was dramatically less competition to get into colleges. The concept of test preparation wasn&#x2019;t on the radar screen. Kids didn&#x2019;t do activities simply for the sake of building the perfect college application. Instead, they had ample time in their childhoods to explore, create, and develop passions. And no matter what your education level was when you entered the workforce, entry-level jobs were relatively easy to secure. For children in America today, those days are long gone.<br><br>Whether over the dinner table or in large auditoriums, we have found it invaluable in setting the tone for a discussion about education to ask participants to reflect on their school years. Specifically, we ask them to describe what aspects of their education had a profound positive impact on them: experiences in and out of the classroom, teachers, mentors, coaches, et cetera. The sharing of these results is revealing, and it gets everyone energized to think hard about what really matters in education.<br> <br>We&#x2019;d like to encourage you to take a few minutes to reflect on the most transformational aspects of your education&#x2014;experiences that took place either inside or outside the classroom. You can jot them down on a piece of paper or in the margin of this book (assuming it&#x2019;s not an e-book!).<br> <br>We&#x2019;ve asked this question to thousands of people and received a wide range of responses. People describe participating in an after-school club; leading a committee; designing and completing an ambitious project; being inspired by a teacher with an infectious love for a given field; hearing from an adult who believed in them; practicing and playing on an athletic team; failing at something and recovering. Not a single person we&#x2019;ve asked has responded, &#x201c;Well, there was a lecture class with multiple-choice quizzes that really changed me.&#x201d;<br> <br>In case you&#x2019;re curious, here&#x2019;s who each of us would like to thank:<br><br>Tony: I changed schools in the twelfth grade, and sadly I cannot recall the name of the teacher who made the greatest difference for me in high school. I&#x2019;ve tried to track him down, but the school I attended then has since closed its doors.<br> <br>I was a late starter as a reader, but I grew to love the beauty and evocativeness of words and stories. I devoured great novels and began writing stories of my own in ninth grade. I wanted to be a novelist. Unfortunately, my English teachers throughout high school were of no help. To the extent that we received any classroom &#x201c;instruction&#x201d; in writing, it consisted of lessons in grammar&#x2014;subject-verb agreement, the proper use of commas, dangling participles, split infinitives, and so on.<br> <br>The few papers my teachers assigned were usually essays, where the purpose of the paper was to repeat the teacher&#x2019;s interpretation of the book we&#x2019;d &#x201c;discussed&#x201d; in class. (The teachers did all the talking!) And they&#x2019;d spend an inordinate amount of time spilling red ink all over our papers. We, like most students today, would glance at the grade, ignore the corrections, and toss the papers in the trash on the way out the door.<br> <br>The twelfth-grade English teacher at my new school was the same as the rest, but there was another English teacher at the school, a kindly and soft-spoken British gentleman, who seemed different. I don&#x2019;t know why but for some reason&#x2014;maybe desperation&#x2014;I mentioned my interest in writing to him and asked if he could help me. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d be delighted&#x201d; was his reply. At his suggestion, we&#x2019;d meet once a week, and he encouraged me to experiment with a different kind of writing or genre for each meeting. One week he&#x2019;d say, &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you try writing a dramatic scene with just dialogue.&#x201d; The next week he might say, &#x201c;How about writing a humorous story this week.&#x201d; Or, &#x201c;Give a childhood reminiscence a try.&#x201d; Or, &#x201c;Have you seen any good movies lately? How about trying a review?&#x201d;<br> <br>He&#x2019;d read each piece as I sat beside him, and he&#x2019;d make just a few comments. He&#x2019;d pick out a word choice or a metaphor that he thought was especially effective. Or he&#x2019;d comment on the evocativeness of a particular scene or the persuasiveness of a paragraph. He&#x2019;d also often suggest things I might want to read: novels, short stories, poems, or essays that were examples of the genre I was playing with in my writing that week.<br> <br>And &#x201c;playing&#x201d; was really the operative word. Years later, I realized that these weekly assignments were the equivalent of artists&#x2019; sketches&#x2014;ways to train the eye (or ear, in this case) and free up the hand. His comments were intended to highlight what was my best writing so that I had a sense of what to strive for.<br> <br>The effect on me was profound. I couldn&#x2019;t stop writing&#x2014;and still can&#x2019;t. I did far more work for this noncredit activity than I&#x2019;d ever done for any of my required classes. And years later when I began to teach writing to a wide variety of high school students&#x2014;from kids at risk in an alterative public school to privileged kids attending an elite private school&#x2014;I used the same method of instruction: I had kids experiment with a new writing genre each week, met with them individually to go over a piece of work, and then encouraged them to polish pieces they especially loved.<br> <br>Ted: Jim Canavan taught me Spanish in high school. He was charismatic, inspiring, and passionate about the Spanish language. What was so unusual about the way Mr. Canavan taught is that it was all about fun. In his class, multiple laugh-filled conversations took place simultaneously. For the entire fifty-minute class period, we&#x2019;d talk&#x2014;entirely in Spanish&#x2014;about school, current events, sports, or funny things that happened in our lives. I can still remember his telling us how his Pontiac Firebird caught fire in his driveway, and the irony of the car&#x2019;s name!<br> <br>Mr. Canavan didn&#x2019;t stand at the front of the class&#x2014;his back to the students&#x2014;writing vocabulary words or verb conjugations on the blackboard. His focus was leading and coaching a great conversation in Spanish&#x2014;with vigorous class participation. At the end of each class, though, he would say, &#x201c;Vaya, y si usted quiere la clase de ma�ana sea a�n m�s divertido, es posible que desee aprender algunas palabras del vocabulario y los verbos de esta noche en casa, y el uso de ellos ma�ana.&#x201d; Or, in English, &#x201c;Gee, and if you want tomorrow&#x2019;s class to be even more fun, you might want to learn some vocabulary words and verbs tonight at home, and use them tomorrow.&#x201d; And we all did, enthusiastically.<br> <br>By the end of his course, we were all conversationally fluent and learned the language in a way that would be retained for life. I&#x2019;ve traveled extensively in Spanish-speaking countries, and forty-five years later can still navigate my way around. In contrast, the two years of French I was required to take in college disappeared completely from my mind seconds after the final exam.<br> <br>In a field where the prevailing (and failed) way to teach a language is a death march through memorization, Mr. Canavan was an outlier. Shortly after I graduated, he gave up the teaching profession. I have tried a few times to find him to say, &#x201c;Thanks for inspiring all of us, and showing that meaningful learning and fun aren&#x2019;t mutually exclusive,&#x201d; but I haven&#x2019;t been able to track him down. I hope, wherever he is, he reads this book, and gets my thank-you.<br><br>This exercise highlights an irony of our education system. For the last century, the classroom experience for most students has revolved around lectures, note-taking, recall-based tests, and grades. Clubs, sports, and social interaction were regarded as providing a welcome break from the intense learning process. We will see, however, that most lecture-based courses contribute almost nothing to real learning. Consequential and retained learning comes, to a very large extent, from applying knowledge to new situations or problems, research on questions and issues that students consider important, peer interaction, activities, and projects. Experiences, rather than short-term memorization, help students develop the skills and motivation that transforms lives.<br> <br>In this book, we will explore the contradiction between what students must do to earn a high school or college degree versus what makes them most likely to succeed in the world of work, citizenship, and lifelong learning. We&#x2019;ll also show what can and must be done to transform education for the twenty-first century and provide examples of best practices in high schools and colleges around the country. And we&#x2019;ll emphasize the urgency of effecting change. In coming chapters, here&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;ll cover:<br> <br>Our beginning chapter, Our Education DNA, delves into why society places such outsized value on academic credentials&#x2014;associating them with a person&#x2019;s intrinsic &#x201c;quality,&#x201d; not just with skills that have been acquired. We have been conditioned to view some types of credentials as being marks of outsized distinction, and certain types of &#x201c;learning&#x201d; (e.g., Latin conjugations) as vastly superior to more base endeavors (understanding how a piece of machinery works).

Synthesizing literature of the previous two decades on the process of social development and the formation of American culture, he challenges the central assumptions that have traditionally been used to analyze colonial British American history.<br><br>Greene argues that the New England declension model traditionally employed by historians is inappropriate for describing social change in all the other early modern British colonies. The settler societies established in Ireland, the Atlantic island colonies of Bermuda and the Bahamas, the West Indies, the Middle Colonies, and the Lower South followed instead a pattern first exhibited in America in the Chesapeake. That pattern involved a process in which these new societies slowly developed into more elaborate cultural entities, each of which had its own distinctive features.<br><br>Greene also stresses the social and cultural convergence between New England and the other regions of colonial British America after 1710 and argues that by the eve of the American Revolution Britain's North American colonies were both more alike and more like the parent society than ever before. He contends as well that the salient features of an emerging American culture during these years are to be found not primarily in New England puritanism but in widely manifest configurations of sociocultural behavior exhibited throughout British North America, including New England, and he emphasized the centrality of slavery to that culture.<br><br></p><p>The Social Development of Early Modern British Colonies and the Formation of American Culture.

The second book in a trilogy, which includes, <i>Man's Eternal Quest</i> and <i>Journey to Self-realization</i> - each of which are packed with information covering a vast range of spiritual topics - <i>The Divine Romance</i> speaks to the deepest needs of the human soul. The great master reveals how we can meet the daily challenges to our physical, psychological, emotional, and spiritual well-being - by awakening our divine nature, the neglected reality at the core of our being. <p>Yogananda said, "The greatest romance you can have is the romance with God....He is the Lover and our souls are the beloved, and when the soul meets the greatest Lover of the universe, then the eternal romance begins. The love that you have been seeking for incarnations through all human loves is at last yours." <br><b>Topics include:</b> <br>How to Work Without Fatigue <br>Where are our Departed Loved Ones? <br>Controlling Your Destiny <br>Why Evil is a Part of God's Creation <br>How to cultivate Divine Love.</p></p><p>Born in India on January 5, 1893, Paramahansa Yogananda devoted his life to helping people of all races and creeds to realize and express more fully in their lives the true beauty, nobility, and divinity of the human spirit. After graduating from Calcutta University in 1915, Yogananda took formal vows as a monk of India's venerable monastic Swami Order. Two years later, he began his life's work with the founding of a how-to-live school since grown to twenty-one educational institutions throughout India where traditional academic subjects were offered together with yoga training and instruction in spiritual ideals. In 1920, he was invited to serve as India's delegate to an International Congress of Religious Liberals in Boston. His address to the Congress and subsequent lectures on the East Coast were enthusiastically received, and in 1924 he embarked on a cross-continental speaking tour. Over the next three decades, Paramahansa Yogananda contributed in far-reaching ways to a greater awareness and appreciation in the West of the spiritual wisdom of the East. In Los Angeles, he established an international headquarters for <b>Self-Realization Fellowship,</b> the nonsectarian religious society he had founded in 1920. Through his writings, extensive lecture tours, and the creation of Self-Realization Fellowship temples and meditation centers, he introduced hundreds of thousands of truth-seekers to the ancient science and philosophy of Yoga and its universally applicable methods of meditation. Today, the spiritual and humanitarian work begun by Paramahansa Yogananda continues under the direction of Sri Mrinalini Mata, one of his closest disciples and president of Self-Realization Fellowship/Yogoda Satsanga Society of India since 2011. In addition to publishing his writings, lectures and informal talks (including a comprehensive series of Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons for home study), the society also oversees temples, retreats, and centers around the world.&#34;He was inspired...one of the greats.

Elizabeth Woodville, 'The White Queen', managed to make the transition from commoner to Queen and became the epitome of medieval heroines &#x2013; the commoner who married a King. When she became the wife of Edward IV her actions changed the life of her entire family. Vilified both by their contemporaries and by many historians since, the Woodville family were centre stage during the reigns of Edward IV and Richard III. Elizabeth Woodville became the ancestress of future Kings and Queens. This book takes a fresh look at the lives of Elizabeth's sisters. Although information on them is scarce, by looking at the men they married, their families, the places they lived and the events that they lived through we can catch a glimpse of their lives. Each sister has their own story to tell and they may not have achieved the dizzying heights that their sister did, but they are all fascinating women.</p><p>Sarah J. Hodder began her career in publishing as a Production Manager for Shire Publications, but has had a love of books since childhood. She is passionate about medieval and Tudor history, her particular interest being in the lives of women.

Then he was offered a chance to make a record and &#x201c;Leif Garrett, teen idol&#x201d; was born. Millions of teenage girls all over the world covered their walls with his picture. His face adorned hundreds of international magazine covers as he became one of the biggest and most desired heartthrobs in history. There were jet-setting tours, TV specials, and hit records, along with an endless supply of beautiful women, alcohol, and ultimately, the drugs that sent this shooting star into the darkest depths of addiction. <i>Idol Truth</i> is a harrowing survivor&#x2019;s story as well as a charmed tale filled with compelling pop culture characters&#x2014;from Michael Jackson and Brooke Shields to John Belushi, Freddie Mercury, and many more. It&#x2019;s the first time ever that Leif Garrett has come clean about his life, revealing all the details of his spectacular journey.</p><p>Leif Garrett burst onto the scene in 1966 at the early age of five. Garrett began a career in acting with his debut in the quintessential period film,<i>&nbsp;Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice</i>.&nbsp;He starred in over sixty hit television shows, such as being the semi-regular on the critically acclaimed hit television shows,&nbsp;<i>The Waltons&nbsp;and&nbsp;Family</i>. But it was his portrayal of a pony express rider in the television special,<i>&nbsp;Peter Lundy and the Medicine Hat Stallion,&nbsp;</i>that garnered Garrett the honor of being inducted into the Cowboy Hall of Fame. From then on, he continued to do more TV and film including&nbsp;<i>Walking Tall</i>&nbsp;and the hit television series,&nbsp;<i>Three for the Road.</i>&nbsp;This family drama was Garrett&#x2019;s launching pad for the recording phenomena that was to occur. Having achieved tremendous success as an actor, Garrett took on the music industry. He became a multi-gold and platinum recording artist and one of the biggest teen idols of all time, gracing magazine covers all over the world.<br> <br>Chris Epting is an award-winning journalist and the author of over thirty books including<i> Change of Seasons</i>, a memoir (with John Oates) from St. Martin&#x2019;s Press, <i>Adrenalized</i> (a memoir with Def Leppard&#x2019;s Phil Collen) from Simon &amp; Schuster and<i> James Dean Died Here </i>from Santa Monica Press.</p><h2>Is This Heaven?: The Magic of the Field of Dreams</h2><p>More than three decades ago, the film Field of Dreams made grown men cry with its tale of a son&#39;s quest to know his father through the magic of baseball. The mystical baseball field of that movie continues to attract thousands of visitors and here is the story of a make-believe place made real, its incredible lure, and its effect on the people who have stepped between its chalk lines.</p><p>Brett Mandel is a director in the Office of the Controller for the City of Philadelphia, where he lives with his wife and daughter. He is author of Minor Players, Major Dreams, which offers the inside story on minor league life.This is his third book.I never really planned to write a book about the Field of Dreams movie site. <p>I liked the film Feild of Dreams and, like many, cried at the ending. But I like a lot of films, and I am an easy mark for a weepy movie . Nothing about the film or my fondness for it would have suggested that, some day, I would write about Field of Dreams and how it has inspired a pilgrimage to the still-surviving movie site. </p><p>But, much as Ray Kinsella heard that voice in film, I had a calling. For me, it was nothing mystical. The voice that came to me was the voice of an agent on the phone. Ray Kinsella heard, "If you build it, he will come." I heard a less ethereal offer to explore the idea of a book about the Field of Dreams movie site near Dyersville, Iowa, and how it had become a pop culture mecca. That was 1996. </p><p>I liked the idea and began my exploration of the phenomena surrounding Dyersville's unique attraction. I worked for a number of months conducting research, creating a book proposal, and putting together some writing. In essence, I suggested that my book would try to explain why people from all over the world were traveling to Dyersville to visit a former movie set and why they were not just going there to take pictures but were visiting in search of a setting for some deeply personal emotional experiences. </p><p>We pitched the idea and received some positive responses, but no publisher offered to fund the project. Just as Ray Kinsella spent many nights looking at the field he created waiting for something to happen, I dashed to the mailbox and jumped when the phone rang, hoping I would receive good news about the book proposal. "Shoeless" Joe Jackson appeared for Ray, but I received no positive news. So the Field of Dreams book files were packed away, and I moved on to other projects. I thought a lot about Dyersville's attraction but considered the matter closed. </p><p>In 2000, like a voice from out of the corn, a fellow author called and asked whether I would share the idea for the book about the Field of Dreams with his publisher. Suddenly, the project was moving forward again. </p><p>I did much of my research for the project over the phone and in libraries in 1996. In 2000, I was able to find a wealth of information by using the Internet. But, of course, the only way to truly explore whether there is magic in the Dyersville corn was to hit the road. More than three years after I had decided I would never get a chance to tell the story, I found myself standing on the Field of Dreams, laughing at myself for the silly grin I sported, feeling as if I had stepped through the looking glass and into something uniquely charmed. </p><p>I have been fortunate enough in my life to have visited significant sites across the globe and have walked in famous footsteps of biblical figures and historical luminaries. I have stood on ground considered holy and have pondered events that changed the world within the walls where they occurred. </p><p>I cannot say that my visit to the Field of Dreams could generate the same chills I felt watching the pious in Rome or Jerusalem or thinking about the tremendous events that transpired in Independence Hall or at Gettysburg. </p><p>That said, there was something very special about standing on the Field of Dreams. It did not take much imagination at all to believe that I was not just at the place where Field of Dreams was filmed, but I was actually part of an ongoing story that simply included the chapter told by Hollywood. </p><p>I spent my time in Dyersville throwing batting practice, swinging for the corn, meeting visitors, and talking to people whose lives had been changed by the field. During my months of research, I consulted scholarly tomes and entertainment magazines. I viewed Field of Dreams and watched videos about people who traveled to Dyersville. I spoke to movie stars and major leaguers and interviewed dozens of people for whom the Field of Dreams is much more than just a tourist attraction. </p><p>Putting the book together was both fun and moving. I nearly took the head off a little leaguer when I lined his batting practice pitch back up the middle. I grooved a fat pitch to a middle-aged man who hit one into the corn and then whooped around the bases in triumph. I wiped tears from my eyes as I ran up my long-distance bills listening to people describe what the Field of Dreams meant to them. </p><p>I had a great time in Dyersville and really enjoyed learning some of the behind-the-scenes stories about the filming of Feild of Dreams and the goings-on at the Field of Dreams. I was touched by the people who opened up to me and shared some very personal stories. A few had to pause to keep from choking up while talking. Some cried as they spoke. </p><p>The tale of the continuing pilgrimage to the Field of Dreams is more than just a tale of camera-toting tourists or souvenir-seeking movie buffs. It is the tale of people who seek something significant in a world that often denies the spiritual, of people who seek ways to communicate powerful emotions, and of people who visit a baseball field, not for batting practice but for redemption. </p><p>I am glad that I had a chance to tell this story.</p></p><h2>Kepler&#39;s Witch: An Astronomer&#39;s Discovery of Cosmic Order Amid Religious War, Political Intrigue, and the Heresy Trial of His Mother</h2><p><p>Set against the backdrop of the witchcraft trial of his mother, this lively biography of Johannes Kepler &#x2013; 'the Protestant Galileo' and 16th century mathematician and astronomer &#x2013; reveals the surprisingly spiritual nature of the quest of early modern science.</p><p> In the style of Dava Sobel's <em>Galileo's Daughter</em>, Connor's book brings to life the tidal forces of Reformation, Counter&#x2013;Reformation, and social upheaval. Johannes Kepler, who discovered the three basic laws of planetary motion, was persecuted for his support of the Copernican system. After a neighbour accused his mother of witchcraft, Kepler quit his post as the Imperial mathematician to defend her.</p><p> James Connor tells Kepler's story as a pilgrimage, a spiritual journey into the modern world through war and disease and terrible injustice, a journey reflected in the evolution of Kepler's geometrical model of the cosmos into a musical model, harmony into greater harmony. The leitmotif of the witch trial adds a third dimension to Kepler's biography by setting his personal life within his own times. The acts of this trial, including Kepler's letters and the accounts of the witnesses, although published in their original German dialects, had never before been translated into English. Echoing some of Dava Sobel's work for <em>Galileo's Daughter</em>, Connor has translated the witch trial documents into English. With a great respect for the history of these times and the life of this man, Connor's accessible story illuminates the life of Kepler, the man of science, but also Kepler, a man of uncommon faith and vision.</p></p><p><p>James A. Connor is the author of <em>Kepler's Witch: An Astronomer's Discovery of Cosmic Order Amid Religious War</em>, <em>Political Intrigue, and the Heresy Trial of His Mother</em> and <em>Silent Fire: Bringing the Spirituality of Silence to Everyday Life</em>. A former Jesuit priest, Connor is professor of English at Kean University in Union, New Jersey; he has also held teaching posts at St. Louis University and Gonzaga University. He is a director of studies at the Lessing Institute in Prague. He holds degrees in geoscience, philosophy, theology, and creative writing, and a Ph.D. in literature and science. He is a prize-winning essayist published widely in such places as <em>American Book Review</em>, <em>Traditional Home</em>, <em>Willow Springs</em>, <em>The Critic</em>, <em>The Iowa Review</em>, and <em>The Iowa Journal of Literary Studies</em>.</p>On his deathbed, one of history's greatest astronomers voiced no satisfaction over his achievements in advancing planetary physics but a great deal of frustration over his lifelong powerlessness to resolve religious conflict. A former Jesuit, Connor here probes the dark religious events that enshrouded the brilliant scientific career of Johannes Kepler. The forces of Reformation and Counter-Reformation repeatedly convulsed the European world in which Kepler pursued his pioneering research, but Connor chiefly scrutinizes the religious turmoil peculiar to Kepler's life. Readers see, for instance, how Kepler fought to maintain friendships with both Catholics and Protestants, how he struggled to harmonize his own sophisticated faith with his wife's simple piety, how he suffered when his intellectual openness cost him his cherished communion as a Lutheran, and, finally, how he jeopardized his reputation to defend an eccentric mother accused of witchcraft. Rich with new translations of Kepler's journals, poetry, and correspondence, this compelling narrative will leave readers wondering how a man so enmeshed in religious travail ever managed to penetrate the mystery of planetary orbits, to blaze a path toward calculus, and to formulate the founding principles of optics. But nothing will astound readers more than the way the religiously vexed Kepler persisted in interpreting his discoveries as evidence of the divine harmony in the universe! Connor indeed argues that precisely because he framed his science in the language of worship, Kepler has received less than his due from rationally minded scholars. This luminous biography will help remedy that injustice. <i>Bryce Christensen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

What do these superbly rendered paintings of horses, bison, and enigmatic human figures and symbols mean? How can we explain the sudden flourishing of artistic creativity at such a high level? And in what ways does this artwork reflect the underlying belief system, worldview, and life of the people who created it?In this fascinating discussion of ancient art and religion, Dr. David S. Whitley&#x2015;one of the world's leading experts on cave paintings&#x2015;guides the reader in an exploration of these intriguing questions, while sharing his firsthand experiences in visiting these exquisite, breathtaking sites.To grasp what drove these ancient artists to create these masterpieces, and to understand the origin of myth and religion, as Whitley explains, is to appreciate what makes us human. Moreover, he broadens our understanding of the genesis of creativity and myth by proposing a radically new and original theory that weds two seemingly warring camps from separate disciplines.On the one hand, archaeologists specializing in prehistoric cave paintings have argued that the visionary rituals of shamans led to the creation of this expressive art. They consider shamanism to be the earliest known form of religion. By contrast, evolutionary psychologists view the emergence of religious beliefs as a normal expression of the human mind. In their eyes, the wild and ecstatic trances of shamans were a form of aberrant behavior. Far from being typical representatives of ancient religion, shamans were exceptions to the normal rule of early religion.Whitley resolves the controversy by interweaving the archaeological evidence with the latest findings of cutting-edge neuroscience. He thereby rewrites our understanding of shamanism and its connection with artistic creativity, myth, and religion.Combining a colorful narrative describing Whitley's personal explorations at key archaeological sites with robust scientific research, Cave Paintings and the Human Spirit makes for engrossing reading. It provides a profound and poignant perspective on what it means to be human.</p><p>David S.

In her more than twenty novels, psychopaths lie in wait amid the milieu of the mundane, in the neighbor clipping the hedges or the spouse asleep next to you at night. Now, Norton continues the revival of this noir genius with another of her lost masterpieces: a later work from 1983, <em>People Who Knock on the Door</em>, is a tale about blind faith and the slippery notion of justice that lies beneath the peculiarly American veneer of righteousness. This novel, out of print for years, again attests to Highsmith's reputation as "the poet of apprehension" (Graham Greene).</p></p><p>Patricia Highsmith (1921&#x2013;1995) was the author of more than twenty novels, including Strangers on a Train, The Price of Salt,&nbsp;The Blunderer and The Talented Mr. Ripley, as well as numerous short stories.Published in 1954 and 1985, respectively, this duo offer more of Highsmith's signature characters in plots where fairly ordinary people perform extraordinary acts of brutality. The Blunderer finds protagonist Walter Stackhouse, who fantasizes about knocking off his wife, in hot water with the cops after the Mrs. ends up at the bottom of a cliff. When Richard Alderman becomes a born-again Christian in People Who Knock on Doors, his family is shattered, leading to a violent outcome. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>You&#39;ll Miss Me When I&#39;m Gone</h2><p><b>No Forgiveness</b><br><br>Andrea Boyle moved to Seattle to give her seventeen-year-old nephew, Spencer, a fresh start after the death of his parents.

Her minnow silver dress swishes against the tops of her thighs like Christmas tinsel as she opens the hotel door.<br> <br>I struggle to remember her name.<br> <br>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;ll tell your father at the consulate about me?&#x201d; Her lipstick is smeared across her cheek. I should tell her to fix it, but my self-loathing is so great that I hate her along with myself.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I say.<br> <br>My father never worked at any consulate. He&#x2019;s not paying girls a hundred grand a pop to go on a goodwill tour of Europe. I&#x2019;m not a talent scout for America&#x2019;s Next Top Model. My uncle doesn&#x2019;t manage U2. I haven&#x2019;t inherited a chain of hotels. There are no diamond mines on my family land in Tanzania. I have never been to Tanzania. These are just a few of the stories my mother has spent the summer spinning for a string of blond girls in the hope that they&#x2019;ll make me forget Lila.<br> <br>They don&#x2019;t.<br> <br>I look up at the ceiling. I keep on staring at it until I hear my mother start to move in the adjoining room.<br> <br>Mom got out of jail a couple months back. After school let out she relocated us both to Atlantic City, where we&#x2019;ve been grifting rooms and charging up whatever food and drink we want to them. If the staff gets too demanding about payment, we simply move down the strip. Being an emotion worker means that Mom never leaves a credit card at the desk.<br> <br>As I think that, she opens the door between our rooms.<br> <br>&#x201c;Honey,&#x201d; Mom says, as though it&#x2019;s not at all weird to find me lying on the floor in my boxers. Her black hair is up in clips and wrapped in one of her silk scarves, the way she always wears it when she sleeps. She&#x2019;s got on the hotel robe from the last hotel, tied tightly around her ample waist. &#x201c;You ready for some breakfast?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just coffee, I think. I&#x2019;ll make it.&#x201d; I push myself up and pad over to the complimentary pot. There&#x2019;s a bag of grounds, sugar, and some powdered creamer sitting on a plastic tray.<br> <br>&#x201c;Cassel, how many times do I have to tell you that it isn&#x2019;t safe to drink out of those things? Someone could have been brewing meth in it.&#x201d; Mom frowns. She always worries about the weirdest things. Hotel coffeepots. Cell phones. Never normal stuff, like the police. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll order us both up coffee from the kitchen.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They could be brewing meth there, too,&#x201d; I say, but she ignores me.<br> <br>She goes into her room and I can hear her make the call. Then she comes back to the doorway. &#x201c;I ordered you some egg whites and toast. And juice. I know you said you weren&#x2019;t hungry, but you need to keep your strength up for today. I found us a new mark.&#x201d; Her smile is big enough that I almost want to smile along with her.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s my mom.<br> <br>Believe it or not, there are magazines out there called, like, Millionaire Living or New Jersey Millionaires or whatever, that feature profiles of old guys in their homes, showing off their stuff. I have no idea who else buys them, but they&#x2019;re perfect for my mother. I think she sees them as gold digger shopping catalogs.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s where she found Clyde Austin. He&#x2019;s on the page after a feature with curse-worker-hating Governor Patton at his mansion, Drumthwacket. Despite a recent divorce, according to the article, Austin still manages to enjoy a lifestyle that includes a private plane, a heated infinity pool, and two borzois that travel with him everywhere. He has a home in Atlantic City, where he likes to go out to dinner at Morton&#x2019;s and play a little blackjack when he can get away from the office. The picture of him shows a short, squat dude with hair plugs.<br> <br>&#x201c;Put on something dirty,&#x201d; Mom says. She&#x2019;s at her desk, altering a new pair of bright blue gloves. She&#x2019;s seeding them with tiny holes at the fingertips: small enough to go unnoticed, big enough for her skin to touch the mark&#x2019;s.<br> <br>&#x201c;Dirty?&#x201d; I say from the couch I&#x2019;m slumped on in her suite. I&#x2019;m on my third cup of coffee, all three choked with cream. I ate the toast, too.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wrinkled. Something that makes you look homeless and desperate.&#x201d; She begins to take down her curls, one by one. Soon she&#x2019;ll start rubbing gunk into her skin and curling her eyelashes. It takes her hours to get ready.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the plan?&#x201d; I ask.<br> <br>&#x201c;I posed as his secretary and pretended I forgot when his reservation was for,&#x201d; Mom says. &#x201c;At Morton&#x2019;s. Wasn&#x2019;t it great how the magazine comes right out and says where to find him? It absolutely worked. He&#x2019;s going to eat there at eight o&#x2019;clock tonight.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How long have you known that for?&#x201d; I ask her.<br> <br>&#x201c;A couple days.&#x201d; She shrugs, making a careful line of black above her eyes. There&#x2019;s no telling how long she really knew. &#x201c;Oh&#x2014;and grab the plastic bag over by my suitcase.&#x201d;<br> <br>I slug down the last of the coffee and get up. The bag contains panty hose. I put them on her desk.<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re for you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You want me to look homeless, desperate, but also kind of fabulous?&#x201d; I ask.<br> <br>&#x201c;Over your head,&#x201d; she says, turning in her chair and miming the gesture like I&#x2019;m a moron. &#x201c;If Clyde works out, I want him to be able to meet you as my son.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It sounds like you&#x2019;ve really got some plan cooked up,&#x201d; I say.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, come on,&#x201d; she demands. &#x201c;School starts in less than a week. Don&#x2019;t you want to have a little fun?&#x201d;<br> <br>Several hours later Mom clops along the boardwalk behind me in platform heels. Her white dress blows in the late summer wind. The neckline is low enough that I&#x2019;m worried her boobs are going to actually fall out if she moves too fast. I know it&#x2019;s disturbing that I notice, but I&#x2019;m not blind.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know what you&#x2019;re supposed to do, right?&#x201d; she says.<br> <br>I wait for her to catch up. She has on gold lame gloves and is carrying a gold clutch purse. I guess she decided against the blue. Altogether it&#x2019;s quite an outfit. &#x201c;No, why don&#x2019;t you tell me for the millionth time?&#x201d;<br> <br>I see the fury pass over her face like a storm. Her eyes go hard.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got it, Mom,&#x201d; I say in what I hope is a conciliatory way. &#x201c;Go on ahead. We shouldn&#x2019;t be talking.&#x201d;<br> <br>She totters off toward the restaurant, and I walk to the railing, looking at the sea. It&#x2019;s the same view I had from Zacharov&#x2019;s Atlantic City penthouse. I think of Lila with her back to me, staring out at black water.<br> <br>I should have told her I loved her back then. Back when it would have meant something.<br> <br>Waiting is the hardest thing about any con job. The moments slip by and your hands start to sweat, anticipating what&#x2019;s coming. Your mind wanders. You&#x2019;re all keyed up from adrenaline, but there&#x2019;s nothing to do.<br> <br>Distraction leads to disaster. Mom&#x2019;s rule.<br> <br>I turn back toward the restaurant and slip my gloved hand into my pocket, touching the wadded-up piece of panty hose. I hacked off the foot with a room service knife.<br> <br>I keep focused, eyeing the crowd, watching my mother vamp up her incredibly slow stroll. We could be here awhile. And, honestly, this plan might not even work. That&#x2019;s another thing about cons; you have to go after a bunch of marks before you find the perfect one. The one you can really take for all he&#x2019;s worth.<br> <br>We wait for twenty minutes, almost a block apart from each other. Mom has done all the innocent things someone does on a nighttime stroll: smoked a cigarette, checked her lipstick, made fake calls on the cell phone she borrowed from me. I, on the other hand, have taken to begging for change. I&#x2019;ve made about $3.50 and am about to land another quarter when Clyde Austin lurches out of Morton&#x2019;s.<br> <br>Mom starts to move.<br> <br>I jump up and take off toward her, yanking the panty hose down over my face. That slows me down some, because there is no way in hell these things are sheer. I can barely see.<br> <br>People start yelling. Yeah, because a guy with hose over his head is never the good guy. He is, in fact, the stereotype&#x2014;maybe even the archetype&#x2014;of a bad guy.<br> <br>I keep running, flying past my mother and yanking the gold clutch out of her hand.<br> <br>She adds her screams to the chorus.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thief!&#x201d; my mother screams. &#x201c;Help! Heeeeelp!&#x201d;<br> <br>Now, this is the tricky part. I have to keep running, but I have to run just slowly enough that a drunk and out-of-shape guy with a couple of martinis rolling around in his belly actually thinks he can catch me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Please&#x2014;someone!&#x201d; Mom shrieks. &#x201c;He has all my money!&#x201d;<br> <br>It&#x2019;s really hard not to laugh.<br> <br>I practically run into Clyde, making sure he&#x2019;s got a shot at me. But I&#x2019;ve got to give it to Mom. She&#x2019;s right when she says that guys want to be knights in shining armor. He grabs for my arm.<br> <br>I let myself fall.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s a bad one. Maybe it&#x2019;s the panty hose over my face, or maybe I&#x2019;m just off balance, but I go down hard on the asphalt, scraping one hand so roughly, I can feel my glove shred. I&#x2019;m pretty sure I scrape my knees, too, but all they feel is numb.<br> <br>I drop the purse.<br> <br>Clyde clocks me in the back of the head before I can push myself to my feet. It hurts. She better appreciate this. Then I&#x2019;m up and running. Full out. Pulling that crap off my face and hurling myself through the night as fast as I can.<br> <br>Leaving Clyde Austin to be a hero, bringing a damsel in distress her golden clutch purse.<br> <br>Leaving him to notice how charming she is when her eyes well up with gratitude.<br> <br>Leaving him to check out her rack.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br> <br>Mom is exultant. She breaks out the bottle of Prosecco from the minibar while I pour frothing hydrogen peroxide over my hand. It stings like crazy.<br> <br>&#x201c;He wants to meet for drinks tomorrow night. I told him it was the least I could do to take him out. He said that, after what I&#x2019;d been through, he was going to pay, and that was that. Now, doesn&#x2019;t that sound promising?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I tell her.<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s going to pick me up here. At six. Do you think I should be ready when he gets here or do you think I should invite him in for a drink while I do a few last little things? Maybe be in my robe?&#x201d;<br> <br>I make a face. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Stop thinking of it that way. This is a job. We need someone to provide for us. Pay for your fancy school&#x2014;and Barron&#x2019;s loans. Especially now that Philip can&#x2019;t be sure how long he&#x2019;s going to stay employed.&#x201d; She cuts me a dark look, like I somehow forgot that I&#x2019;m the one that got him in trouble with the boss of a crime family. Like I am going to start caring. They&#x2019;ve done much worse to me.<br> <br>&#x201c;So long as you don&#x2019;t work Clyde,&#x201d; I say quietly. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need to. You&#x2019;re plenty charming on your own.&#x201d;<br> <br>She laughs and pours her Prosecco into a water glass. It fizzes like the peroxide. &#x201c;Like mother, like son. We&#x2019;re both charming when we want something. Right, Cassel?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So I want you to stay out of jail,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;So what? Is that supposed to be a secret?&#x201d;<br> <br>The doorbell of her room buzzes. &#x201c;What did you order?&#x201d; I ask her, and head over to open it.<br> <br>Mom makes a sound of alarm, but she&#x2019;s too late.<br> <br>Clyde Austin is standing in the hallway, a bottle of Jack Daniel&#x2019;s swinging from one hand. &#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; he says, embarrassed. &#x201c;I must have the wrong room. I thought&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Then he gets a good look at me&#x2014;at the blood on my jeans, the scrape on my bare hand. And he sees my mother sitting on the bed. And he knows. His face goes ugly.<br> <br>&#x201c;You set me up,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;You and her.&#x201d; The way he says &#x201c;her&#x201d; tells me everything he&#x2019;s thinking about us.<br> <br>I start to explain, when he swings the bottle at my head. I see it moving, but I am too clumsy, too slow. It makes a hollow, horrible thunk against my temple.<br> <br>I hit the carpet, dizzy. Dull pain makes me nauseous. That&#x2019;s what I get for underestimating the guy. I roll onto my back just in time to see him over me, raising the Jack Daniel&#x2019;s to strike again.<br> <br>With a shriek Mom rakes her nails against his neck.<br> <br>He whirls around, wild, swinging. His elbow connects. She flies back against the desk. Her magnifying mirror cracks against the wall, the shards falling like glittering confetti.<br> <br>I reach up my bare hand. I could stop him with a single touch.<br> <br>I could change him into a cockroach.<br> <br>I could transform him into a puddle of grease.<br> <br>I really want to.<br> <br>Clyde has gone still, though, looking around like he suddenly doesn&#x2019;t know where he is. &#x201c;Shandra?&#x201d; he says gently, reaching for my mother. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry. Did I hurt you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; Mom says in a soothing voice, getting up slowly. She winces. There&#x2019;s blood on her lip. &#x201c;You just came by to bring me a little liquor, didn&#x2019;t you? And you saw my son. Maybe you mistook him for someone else.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I guess,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;We got along so well that I figured why wait until tomorrow night? And then . . . He does look like the mugger, you have to admit.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mom&#x2019;s an emotion worker. She can&#x2019;t change his memories; my brother Barron could do that, but he&#x2019;s not here. What Mom can do with a single bare-handed touch is make Clyde Austin like her so much that he&#x2019;s willing to give her the benefit of the doubt. About anything. Everything. Even this.<br> <br>A wave of dizziness overwhelms me.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s true, baby,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;He does look a little like the mugger. It was an honest mistake. I&#x2019;m just going to walk you to the door now.&#x201d; Her fingers go to his neck, which should make anybody flinch&#x2014;bare fingers, no glove&#x2014;but it doesn&#x2019;t bother him at all. He lets himself be steered.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m really sorry for what happened,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what came over me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I understand,&#x201d; Mom tells him. &#x201c;And I forgive you, but I don&#x2019;t think that we can see each other tomorrow night. You get that, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>Shame heats his face. &#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;<br> <br>My vision blurs. She says something else soothing, but not to me.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br> <br>We check out in the morning. Sunlight makes my brain feel like it&#x2019;s throbbing inside my skull. Sweat slicks my skin&#x2014;the kind of unnatural sweat that comes along with injury. Each movement makes me as dizzy as riding a thousand roller coasters all at once. While we wait for the valet to get my car, I fumble through my backpack for sunglasses and try to avoid looking at the dark bruise on Mom&#x2019;s shoulder.<br> <br>She&#x2019;s been totally silent since she told me we were leaving&#x2014;all through packing and even the ride down in the elevator. I can tell she&#x2019;s seething.<br> <br>I feel too sick to know what to do about it.<br> <br>Finally my ancient and rusted Benz drives up to the front of the hotel. Mom hands something to the driver and gets the keys while I slide in on the other side. The seat is hot on the backs of my legs, even through jeans.<br> <br>&#x201c;How could you answer the door like that?&#x201d; she shouts as soon as we pull away from the curb. &#x201c;Not looking through the peephole. Not calling out to ask who was there?&#x201d;<br> <br>I flinch at her voice.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you stupid, Cassel? Didn&#x2019;t I teach you better than that?&#x201d;<br> <br>She&#x2019;s right. It was thoughtless. Stupid. Private school has made me careless. It&#x2019;s exactly the kind of dumb mistake that separates a decent con man from an amateur. Plus the blowback from the emotion work makes her unstable. Not that she isn&#x2019;t normally pretty unstable. But working magnifies it. So does anger. There&#x2019;s nothing for me to do but ride it out.<br> <br>I was used to her being like this when I was a kid.

With the development of language and the process of acculturation not only do our direct experiences of the world become much less vivid but our innate states of nonordinary consciousness become suppressed. Trapped in a specific cultural context--a &#x201c;cosmic egg&#x201d;--we are no longer able to have or even recognize mystical experiences not mediated by the limitations of our culture. Motivated primarily by a fear of death, our enculturation literally splits our minds and prevents us from living fully in the present. <br> <br>Drawing from Carlos Castaneda&#x2019;s writings about Don Juan and the sense of &#x201c;body-knowing,&#x201d; Pearce explores the varieties of nonordinary consciousness that can help us return to the unencumbered consciousness of our infancy. He shows that just as we each create our own cosmic egg of reality through cultural conditioning, we also innately create a &#x201c;crack&#x201d; in that egg. Ultimately certain shifts in our biological development take place to offset acculturation, leaving an avenue of return to our primary state. Pearce examines the creation of the &#x201c;egg&#x201d; itself and ways to discover its inherent cracks to restore wholeness to our minds, release us from our fear of death, and reestablish our ability to create our own realities through imagination and biological transcendence.</p><p>Joseph Chilton Pearce (1926-2016) is the author of <i>The Death of Religion and the Rebirth of the Spirit</i>, <i>The Biology of Transcendence</i>, <i>The Crack in the Cosmic Egg</i>, <i>Magical Child</i>, and <i>Evolution&#x2019;s End</i>.

Known as &#x201c;Radical design,&#x201d; this movement probed possibilities for visually transforming the urban environment. Radical design&#x2019;s proponents also applied it to items such as furniture and lighting, utilizing alternative materials and an innovative formal vocabulary. <i>Radical: Italian Design 1965&#x2013;1985</i> surveys the work of these pioneering designers through nearly 70 objects and architectural models&#x2014;including rare prototypes and limited-production pieces.

Also included is all of the practical information needed to make the most of these new opportunities, plus a full update on the accommodation upgrades that have taken place in recent times to cater for the influx of new visitors. <br>The Azores has strong links with the USA, with a healthy diaspora, and a shared history through emigration and whaling.

Safe and welcoming, the islands are drawing in a whole new group of visitors, mainly from Europe and the USA, attracted by the diversity of outdoor activities, easier accessibility and improvements to the visitor infrastructure. The Azores volcanic origin make for a rugged, diverse landscape, a suitable backdrop for excellent walking, mountain-biking and canyoning, while whale-watching, kayaking, windsurfing and fishing provide off-shore opportunities for independent travelers and adventurous families alike. <br><br>The islands' 500 year history is well-documented in a host of museums, allowing visitors to learn about the fluctuating fortunes and strategic importance of the archipelago across the centuries.

The Three Graces&#x2015;goddesses of charm, beauty, and creativity&#x2015;exemplify ease and harmony with one another and the world around them. But what has happened to this simple, marvelous concept of being at ease in the world?<br><br> With warmth, humor, and an ever-perceptive eye, Sarah L. Kaufman sifts the graceful from the graceless, celebrating heart-catching moments of physical elegance in sports, movies, dance, fashion, and music; rare sightings of celebrity grace; the secrets of gracious hosts; and grace found unexpectedly, in the kitchen of a high-end restaurant and among strippers in a basement bar. Kaufman&#x2019;s thought-provoking reflections on these physical and social acts of grace offer hope for even the clumsiest, most awkward among us.<br><br> Guided by the muse of Cary Grant (with further inspiration from Smokey Robinson, Roger Federer, Nelson Mandela, Margot Fonteyn, Amy Purdy, Beyonc�, and others), Kaufman illuminates the importance of grace in the small moments of everyday life. In <em>The Art of Grace</em>, she inspires us to walk taller, spend time on unnecessary kindnesses, and celebrate the grace notes in our lives and those of others.<br> 25 illustrations</p><p>Sarah L.

Because its method is narrative and anecdotal, however, it reads like a passionate memoir--a marvelous document from an extraordinary time. Based on journals he kept at the time, these pages recount his encounters with other communes and experimental living arrangements-some gentle, some brutal; of encounters between those inside and those outside the countercultural life; of idealism and hopes pushing against a resistant reality.</p><p></p><h2>The 4 Season Solution: The Groundbreaking New Plan for Feeling Better, Living Well, and Powering Down Our Always-On Lives</h2><p><b><i>New York Times</i> bestselling coauthor of the runaway bestsellers <i>The Whole30</i> and <i>It Starts With Food</i> presents a paradigm-shifting plan that shows you how to boost energy, improve health, and feel happier by living more in tune with the seasons.</b><br><br>With his runaway bestsellers <i>It Starts with Food </i>and <i>The Whole30, </i>health trailblazer Dallas Hartwig has helped millions of people improve their lives by changing how they eat.

What could he be doing? He&#x2019;d been gone more than half an hour, and all he&#x2019;d had to do was pick up the forgotten tobacco pouch from their hotel room and come right back. They had planned to take the steamer boat across the Falls, but they&#x2019;d miss it if he didn&#x2019;t hurry. She shaded her eyes against the sun, but the road was deserted except for a carriage that was approaching slowly, the horse&#x2019;s head drooping wearily. She consulted the gold fob watch that had been her father&#x2019;s wedding present to her. It was a beautiful and extravagant gift, but the giving of it was marred by her father being in his cups and barely able to utter his congratulation, so that when she did consult the watch, her pride in its richness was tainted by her disappointment in him.<br><br>She shifted back on the bench. To her left, she could see a rainbow arching over the high-flung spray of the cascading water. She had been excited to come here for her honeymoon, but the week so far had been less than happy. Initially, she had been self-conscious, sure that the other guests were staring at them in disapproval. When she confessed this to her husband, he was dismissive rather than kind, but she clung to his words: &#x201c;You are the most beautiful woman in the room. The men covet you and the women are envious. Nobody knows. They think you are a Spanish countess.&#x201d;<br><br>She longed for him to say more, but in the short time they had been married, she had learned not to press forward with any discussion he didn&#x2019;t want to have. When he was courting her, he had been tender and solicitous, but nothing, not even her Aunt Hattie&#x2019;s blunt warnings about &#x201c;man&#x2019;s nature,&#x201d; had prepared her for the roughness of their conjugal relations. She couldn&#x2019;t hide her discomfort, and he was impatient with her. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t have expected such coldness from you of all people.&#x201d; She had cried so hard the first night that he had finally relented and teased and tickled her into a precarious laughter. This morning, she&#x2019;d woken to find him sitting on the edge of the bed, looking at her. He had kissed her fiercely. &#x201c;Today, I want you to wear your best blue silk gown, your largest crinoline, and your big hat with the peacock feathers. You will be the belle of the promenade.&#x201d;<br><br>So she had, and laced herself with unnecessary tightness that she now regretted on this hot day. Another quick check of the watch. What could be keeping him?<br><br>She heard the soft jingle of a horse&#x2019;s bridle and looked over her shoulder again. The carriage had halted and a man was coming across the grass toward her. He was heavy-set with a full untrimmed beard and moustache. His clothes and skin looked grubby. She fancied she could smell his stale sweat, but that impression might have been born only later, when he was on top of her. Somehow, from the first, her flesh knew who he was even though her mind would not accept it. Ever afterwards, she scourged herself for not immediately running toward the protection of the few visitors who were hanging over the railings watching the water. But then he was talking to her and she made the terrible mistake of listening.<br><br>&#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am, I must ask you to accompany me. I have bad news. Your husband has been taken ill. He&#x2019;s in your hotel.&#x201d;<br><br>She gasped. &#x201c;What has happened to him?&#x201d;<br><br>The man shrugged. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t say. All I know is I was sent to find you and bring you to him at once. The doctor&#x2019;s been summoned. You&#x2019;re staying at the Grand, ain&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>She nodded, not taking her eyes from his face, from the mouth that was smiling at her so falsely. Suddenly he stepped forward, and in one swift movement he pulled her from the bench. In a ghastly parody of an embrace, he crushed her against his chest so that her hat was almost knocked off her head, her nose and mouth were smothered, and she couldn&#x2019;t breathe. She felt herself being carried to the carriage and thrust inside.<br><br>There was another man within whom she couldn&#x2019;t see because she was shoved to the floor face down and at the same time something was stuffed in her mouth. It was vile-tasting and leathery, like a glove. The man pinned her with his knee, and in a moment he&#x2019;d tied her hands behind her back. The carriage lurched forward.</p><h2>Asterix and the Banquet: Album #5</h2><p>When the Romans say no, Asterix says yes.

Each study is a solid foundation upon which you can stand or from which you can teach. The texts will edify you in your personal devotion or small group Bible study regardless of which topic you choose.<br><br>Volume 3 of Come and See is a comprehensive study of the Son of God. Dr. Fruchtenbaum s unique focus of looking at Yeshua (Jesus) from a Messianic Jewish perspective adds a dimension to this field of systematic theology that is often missing in the church today. The author works his way through the Hebrew Scriptures and shows how the revelation of the Messiah gradually progressed to reveal a magnificent picture of the Deliverer to come. The study of the life of the Messiah and theologically relevant topics, such as the Incarnation and the Crucifixion, profits from this Jewish frame of reference as well. The questions and study suggestions at the end of the chapters will challenge anyone who desires to dig deeper into the Word of God.</p><p>Arnold G. Fruchtenbaum, Th.M., Ph.D, is one of the foremost authorities on the nation of Israel, and is a messianic Jewish believer.

His graduate work also includes studies at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

(Arbordale Collection)</h2><p><b>Children's Choice Award-finalist</b><br> Packy the Packrat's mother has had enough! It s time that he sorts through his ever-growing collection of trinkets and puts them away. Told in rhyme, the text leads the reader to participate in the sorting process by categorizing Packy's piles of things according to like characteristics and attributes. The reader response is worked into the rhyme, building a sense of anticipation. The illustrations include a humorous subplot about Packy's sister, who enjoys pilfering some of his things for her own enjoyment. Children will relate to the idea of having a collection of favorite objects and the satisfaction that comes from examining and admiring these collectibles. The story promotes and reinforces analogous thinking a critical thinking skill in math, science, and life. In the supplemental activity section at the back of the book, the reader can explore even more attributes and characteristics of objects, including color, size, texture, shape, and material.</p><p>Barbara Mariconda is one of those people who has done it all! An educator (K-6), a mentor teacher, an adjunct professor of Children s Literature and Process Writing, Barbara has also written a wide variety of musicals, songs, and books. She has worked with Children s Television Workshop and Cherry Lane music on the creative staff of the Sesame Street Music Magazine. In addition to writing workbooks and beginning readers, her middle grade novel, Turn the Cup Around, was nominated for an Edgar Allan Poe Award for best children s mystery. She has also published numerous professional books for teachers, frequently speaks on the topic of writing for and with children, and provides professional development for teachers at seminars across the country. She is a partner in the educational seminar/consulting firm, Empowering Writers, LLC., and is a member of SCBWI. Barbara understands that sorting and categorizing, so clearly recognized as a math and science skill, also powerfully relates to writing. In order to write in an organized fashion, to group like details with broader main ideas, to recognize the ways in which main ideas in a piece of writing may overlap and therefore encourage redundancy, it all comes down to the writer s ability to think critically and sort things out. Barbara s huge collections of sea glass, pottery shards, glass paperweights, nutcrackers, wine bottle corks, and cowboy boots, all artfully sorted and arranged, served as the inspiration for this book.PreSchool-Grade 2&#x2014;When Pack rat comes home with a cart full of stuff&#x2014;a locket, a book, an umbrella, a pinecone, and many more random items&#x2014;his mother admonishes him to sort it all out and put it away. Packy does just that, cleverly sorting things with like characteristics such as where they're found, their color, shape, etc. Children who like to collect may be inspired to bring some order to their own assortments. The illustrations are brightly colored, large, and very clear. Careful readers will notice a subplot in the pictures and find satisfaction in seeing its resolution on the final page. In addition, the rhyming text prompts them to guess the word that defines each collection. Back matter has activities to extend the experience. Most collections would benefit from this simple entry into the world of mathematics.&#x2014;<i>Linda M.

It is girls from which stories begin, she wrote in her last notebook. And like other lives, but unlike most fables, it was created through means both within and beyond her control.<br>&#x2015;from <i>After Kathy Acker</i></p><p>Rich girl, street punk, lost girl and icon... scholar, stripper, victim, and media-whore: The late Kathy Acker's legend and writings are wrapped in mythologies, created mostly by Acker herself. Twenty years after her death, Acker's legend has faded, making her writing more legible.<br>In this first, fully authorized, biography, Chris Kraus approaches Acker both as a writer and as a member of the artistic communities from which she emerged. At once forensic and intimate, <i>After Kathy Acker</i> traces the extreme discipline and literary strategies Acker used to develop her work, and the contradictions she longed to embody. Using exhaustive archival research and ongoing conversations with mutual colleagues and friends, Kraus charts Acker's movement through some of the late twentieth century's most significant artistic enterprises.</p><p>Beginning in her mid-teens, Acker lived her ideal of the Great Writer as Cultural Hero, and as Kraus argues, she may well have been the only female writer to succeed in assuming this role. She died of untreated cancer at an alternative clinic in Tijuana when she was fifty years old, but the real pathos of Acker's life may have been in the fact that by then she'd already outlived her ideal.</p></p><p>Chris Kraus is the author of four novels, including <i>I Love Dick </i>and <i>Summer of Hate</i>; two books of art and cultural criticism; and most recently, <i>After Kathy Acker: A Literary Biography</i>.

She lives in Los Angeles.<p>Hardly anyone writes better or more insightfully than Chris Kraus about the lives of women and artists. <i>After Kathy Acker </i>is an intense, riveting portrait of a writer who was raw and savvy, fragile and brilliant, whose self-deceptions were inseparable from her greatness. Quotes from her profane and passionate journals reveal Kathy the crazy poet, the bad girlfriend, the Upper East Side schoolgirl, the downtown writer, Kathy in love and in denial. Gossipy, sexy, tragic, terrific.</p>&#x2015;<b>Julie Phillips</b>, author of <i>The Double Life of Alice B. Sheldon</i><br><br><p>'To lie is to try,' Chris Kraus writes in this examination of the various personae of Kathy Acker, the fucked-up girl from high school who, through lying and trying, became an experimental writer of rare courage and vision. In some ways a contemporary and in some ways as far off as the days when people moved to New York and San Francisco for the cheap rent, Acker needed a key, and Chris Kraus provides it.</p>&#x2015;<b>Benjamin Moser</b>, author of <i>Why This World: A Biography of Clarice Lispector</i><br><br><p>The path of the female artist.

Music, Music, Music. Boys, Boys, Boys: A Memoir</i><br><br><p>Chris Kraus's <i>After Kathy Acker</i> sets the bar for what will surely be a new era of critical and biographical reckoning with the life and work of Kathy Acker.

Fiercely independent attorney Tony Lord dares to defend the shooter, but the already bizarre plot takes another twist. As America watches, a mysterious and ruthless figure, known only as Phoenix, takes to the airwaves-- and takes the wife of a wealthy newspaper mogul and Stacy's manager as his hostages. Phoenix mounts a televised trial of his own--in which Stacy Tarrant and Tony Lord are helpless defendents, millions of viewers are jurors, and--unless his chilling demands are met--Pheonix is the unstoppable executioner....</p><p>The shocking brutal murder of a presidential hopeful.

What causes it? Is it a psychopathology? Can it be changed? Questions like these often accompany discussions of homosexual behavior. For answers we naturally look to scientific studies. But what does the scientific research actually show? More important, what place should this research have in shaping the church&#39;s response? Stanton Jones and Mark Yarhouse help us face these issues squarely and honestly. In four central chapters they examine how scientific research has been used within church debates--in particular within Methodist, Presbyterian and Episcopal contexts. They then survey the most recent and best scientific research and sort out what it actually shows. Next they help us to interpret the research&#39;s relevance to the moral debate within the church. In a concluding chapter they make a strong case for a traditional Christian sexual ethic. Church groups considering these complex issues will find helpful discussion questions at the end of each chapter. This book is essential reading for anyone involved in the church&#39;s debate over homosexual behavior.</p><p>Stanton L.

Starting with assaults on the U.S. Constitution, Griffin reviews various ways in which the world has been made worse over the past fifteen years by the Bush-Cheney reaction to the attacks and by power plays for global influence enabled by 9/11. These include the disastrous effects of regime-change operations in<br><br>Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya; the war on terror, the rise of ISIS, the Syrian conflict and European refugee crisis; the explosion of Islamophobia and the American acceptance of extrajudicial murder-by-drone; and the growing existential threats of ecological and nuclear holocaust. Looking back, it is clear that the story of 9/11 has been used to legitimize and manufacture support for disastrous policies.<br><br>In Bush and Cheney, Griffin analyzes what Noam Chomsky, Paul Craig Roberts, and many others across the political spectrum consider the most serious threat today the threat to global survival. He argues that ripple effects of 9/11 have become so destructive and dangerous that the press, policy elites, and citizens should finally confront what we have allowed to happen. A national reckoning has become essential, in the words of William Rivers Pitt, to stop the dominoes of September from continuing to fall.</p><p>Was America?s response to the 9/11 attacks at the root of today?s instability and terror? Because of various factors, including climate change, ISIS, the war in Syria, the growing numbers of immigrants, and the growing strength of fascist parties in Europe, commentators have increasingly been pointing out that the chaos in the world today was sparked by the post-9/11 attacks on Afghanistan and Iraq. At the same time, there has also been much discussion of ways in which the Bush-Cheney administration?s response to 9/11 has damaged America itself by stimulating Islamophobia and fascist sentiments, undermining key elements in its Constitution, moving towards a police state, and in general weakening its democracy. While the first two parts of this book discuss various ways in which 9/11 has ruined America and the world, the third part discusses a question that is generally avoided: Were the Bush-Cheney attacks on Afghanistan and Iraq really at the root of the ruination of America and the world in general, or did the original sin lie in 9/11 itself?David Ray Griffin is emeritus professor of philosophy of religion and theology at Claremont School of Theology and Claremont Graduate University.

Born in northeastern Tibet in 1935, he was as a toddler recognized as the incarnation of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama and brought to Tibet's capital, Lhasa. In 1950, Mao Zedong's Communist forces made their first incursions into eastern Tibet, shortly after which the young Dalai Lama assumed the political leadership of his country. In 1959, Chinese forces occupied the city, forcing His Holiness to escape to India. There he set up the Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamsala, working to secure the welfare of the more than 100,000 Tibetan exiles and prevent the destruction of Tibetan culture. In his capacity as a spiritual and political leader, he has traveled to more than sixty-two countries on six continents and met with presidents, popes, and leading scientists to foster dialogue and create a better world. In recognition of his tireless work for the nonviolent liberation of Tibet, the Dalai Lama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989. In 2012, he relinquished political authority in his exile government and turned it over to democratically elected representatives.

On a whim, she decided to enter the race. As she boarded a plane to East Asia, she was utterly unprepared for what awaited her.<br><br> Riders often spend years preparing to compete in the Mongol Derby, a course that re-creates the horse messenger system developed by Genghis Khan, and many fail to finish. Prior-Palmer had no formal training. She was driven by her own restlessness, stubbornness, and a lifelong love of horses. She raced for ten days through extreme heat and terrifying storms, catching a few hours of sleep where she could at the homes of nomadic families. Battling bouts of illness and dehydration, exhaustion and bruising falls, she decided she had nothing to lose. Each dawn she rode out again on a fresh horse, scrambling up mountains, swimming through rivers, crossing woodlands and wetlands, arid dunes and open steppe, as American television crews chased her in their jeeps.<br><br> Told with terrific suspense and style, in a voice full of poetry and soul, <i>Rough Magic</i> captures the extraordinary story of one young woman who forged ahead, against all odds, to become the first female winner of this breathtaking race.</p><p><b>LARA PRIOR-PALMER</b> was born in London in 1994.

To her credit, the heroine of this story never claims to be flawless, nor even to be a heroine. Ultimately, the book lingers in the mind partly for its fearless prose and partly for its refusal to obey that tired old victorious arc of the journey narrative. Prior-Palmer both embraces the race and disavows it. She pulls back to observe the minutiae of the moment, the marmot holes that riddle the steppe and the infinite, individual blades of grass that paint it green.

Many, many readers are going to be charmed by <i>Rough Magic</i>, whether they can tack up a horse or not, and rightly so. The setting is exotic. The challenge is extreme.

His army -- General Robert E. Lee's army -- was a surprise to almost everyone: With daring early victories and an invasion into the North, they nearly managed to convince the North to give up the fight. Even in 1865, facing certain defeat after the loss of 30,000 men, a Louisiana private fighting in Lee's army still had hope. "I must not despair," he scribbled in his diary. "Lee will bring order out of chaos, and with the help of our Heavenly Father, all will be well." <br> <br> Astonishingly, after 150 years of scholarship, there are still some major surprises about the Army of Northern Virginia. In General Lee's Army, renowned historian Joseph T. Glatthaar draws on an impressive range of sources assembled over two decades -- from letters and diaries, to official war records, to a new, definitive database of statistics -- to rewrite the history of the Civil War's most important army and, indeed, of the war itself. Glatthaar takes readers from the home front to the heart of the most famous battles of the war: Manassas, the Peninsula campaign, Antietam, Gettysburg, all the way to the final surrender at Appomattox. General Lee's Army penetrates headquarters tents and winter shanties, eliciting the officers' plans, wishes, and prayers; it portrays a world of life, death, healing, and hardship; it investigates the South's commitment to the war and its gradual erosion; and it depicts and analyzes Lee's men in triumph and defeat. <br> <br> The history of Lee's army is a powerful lens on the entire war. The fate of Lee's army explains why the South almost won -- and why it lost. The story of his men -- their reasons for fighting, their cohesion, mounting casualties, diseases, supply problems, and discipline problems -- tells it all. <br> <br> Glatthaar's definitive account settles many historical arguments. The Rebels were fighting above all to defend slavery. More than half of Lee's men were killed, wounded, or captured -- a staggering statistic. Their leader, Robert E. Lee, though far from perfect, held an exalted place in his men's eyes despite a number of mistakes and despite a range of problems among some of his key lieutenants. <br> <br> <i>General Lee's Army</i> is a masterpiece of scholarship and vivid storytelling, narrated as much as possible in the words of the enlisted men and their officers.</p><p><b>JOSEPH T. GLATTHAAR</b> received a B.A. from Ohio Wesleyan University, an M.A. in history from Rice University, and a Ph.D. in history from the University of Wisconsin. He has taught at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, the U.S. Army War College, the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, and the University of Houston and is currently the Stephenson distinguished professor of history and chair of the curriculum in peace, war, and defense at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.<p> <b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> <b>Comedy of Errors,<br> Tragedy of Triumph</b><br> </p><p> Even though James Thomas Petty had resided in Washington, D.C., for years, he always identified himself as a Virginian. When it came time to choose sides in the sectional crisis, Thomas, as his friends called him, had no difficulty. He left the Union for the Confederate States of America just as Virginia did. </p><p> Born in 1836 in Falmouth, Virginia, Thomas lived there and in Front Royal, Virginia, in the shadow of the Blue Ridge Mountains during his youth. His father, James S. Petty, was a tailor by trade, and not a notably successful one at that. In 1860, at age fifty-three, James Petty owned no land and held personal property worth a meager $150.00. Although he never made much money, James and his wife, Margaret, emphasized schooling for their children. At fourteen, Thomas could have helped to ease the financial woes of the family by seeking employment. Instead, his family scrimped while Thomas secured a superior education, which reaped dividends for the rest of his life. </p><p> Avoiding his father's craft and, for that matter, other forms of manual labor, young Thomas gravitated toward the nation's capital in the early 1850s in search of employment. With support from his father's family, he found employment as a clerk, earning decent wages with the promise of economic mobility and financial security. A bright and pleasant lad, about medium height with hazel eyes and dark hair, Thomas carved out a strong network of friends and connections in and around Washington. He socialized broadly, forging relationships with other aspiring young men from modest backgrounds, and with quite a number of single young women. </p><p> On January 1, 1861, Petty called on President James Buchanan to offer him a happy New Year. "Poor Old Buck!" he jotted in his diary. "He looks careworn, and the effects of 'Secession' are visible in his countenance." Barely a week earlier, South Carolina had voted to withdraw from the Union, and rumblings from other slave states suggested that more would follow. </p><p> Along with other Washingtonians, Petty rejoiced when rumors circulated that Senator John Crittenden's committee had eked out a compromise. It would have overseen the adoption of perpetually binding constitutional amendments that would secure slavery forever and guarantee slavery in territories south of the Missouri Compromise line, 36�, 30'. "A mountain seemd removed from every heart," he exulted. But that, too, quickly unraveled. </p><p> Soon, the electricity of the times seized him, as it did hundreds of thousands of others. The thrill of momentous events, the culmination of decades of struggle over the legality and geography of slavery, was so exciting that it clouded his mind to solutions and consequences. "The South," he proclaimed joyously, "is in a blaze." On behalf of the Commonwealth of Virginia, he argued with friends so vociferously that he had to avoid political discussions to preserve his bond with them. When Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor fell to Rebel gunners in mid-April, he erupted with joy. Soon thereafter, when Virginia seceded, he announced his decision: "All my friends nearly condemn me but believing I'm right I still cry hurrah for Old Virginia! Whither she goes I'll follow." </p><p> Although neither Petty nor his parents had slaves, many people he knew from days as a youth and an adult did -- his uncle in Front Royal owned a dozen. Slaveholding was a Southern right, and Petty detested "Black Republicans" for their goals of stripping Southerners of their civil liberties as the Constitutional Convention of 1787 had reaffirmed. He took great pride in his standing as <i>"Virginian &amp; a Southerner."</i> </p><p> By mid-April, Petty had written his parents to inform them where he stood on the national crisis. A week later, he arrived in Front Royal, determined to enlist in the army. Two of his cousins had already left for Harpers Ferry to serve in the Warren Rifles, and he decided to join them. Before the month was out, Thomas Petty drilled on the green in front of Christ Episcopal Church in Alexandria, where George Washington and Robert E. Lee had worshiped. </p><p> It did not take long before Petty's officers discovered the value of his clerking talents. After a stint as recorder for a court-martial, duty that earned him the praise of the judge advocate, his captain asked him to prepare the company rolls. Soon, the brigade commissary sought his labor, and a struggle for Petty's services ensued that went all the way to the brigade commander, Brig. Gen. James Longstreet. Longstreet directed that Petty should remain with his regiment. </p><p> In mid-July, a Union army of 32,000 under Brig. Gen. Irvin McDowell marched southward toward the main Confederate body that guarded Manassas Junction, where the Manassas Gap Railroad from Front Royal intersected the Orange &amp; Alexandria Railroad. Advanced Rebel units fell back in the face of the large Union column, joining forces with other elements of Brig. Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard's command behind a sluggish, fairly shallow stream with steep banks called Bull Run, about one and a half miles from Manassas Junction. </p><p> Petty's regiment, the 17th Virginia Infantry, had only pulled its component companies together in late June. Along with the rest of Longstreet's Brigade, it guarded Blackburn's Ford across Bull Run, on the right of Beauregard's line. </p><p> About noon on July 18, the lead column of the Union command approached, placing the entire regiment under fire for the first time. To open the contest, Union artillery hurled projectiles to the left of the brigade. Soon, the fire drifted on top of the 17th. As the soldiers hugged the ground for protection, Federal infantrymen deployed and delivered volleys at the Rebel line. Some soldiers panicked and began withdrawing to the rear. Suddenly, Longstreet rode among them. A large and powerful man who appeared like a giant on horseback, Longstreet's imperturbability amid enemy gunfire reassured the raw troops and restored order. Others held their ground but nervously fidgeted with their firing hammers, itching for a chance to respond in kind. Once Confederates countered with volleys of their own, many of them regained composure. The mere act of defending themselves, and the physical activity of loading and firing, dissipated skittishness among the inexperienced volunteers. </p><p> In haste, soldiers loaded and fired, but not in accordance with the procedures officers had taught the men. Perspiration streamed down on the warm day, combining with gunpowder to form a black batter on their faces. Hands, too, took on a charcoal hue from careless pouring of gunpowder into musket barrels. Most men were soon barely recognizable. Hours passed in what appeared to be only seconds. One soldier recalled little of the fight, except his captain parading behind them directing their fire, and his shooting a Yankee some seventy yards out. For that act of killing, he shed no tears of remorse. "Well, I was fighting, for my house, and he had no business there," he wrote. </p><p> Three times the Yankees tried to drive off the Rebel defenders, and three times they fought them back. Finally, Rebel volleys suppressed Federal rifle fire enough to allow three companies from the 17th Virginia to rush across Bull Run. Popping up on the Union flank, they delivered withering blasts that forced the attackers into retreat. </p><p> Despite some shaky moments, Longstreet's Brigade, and the 17th Virginia Infantry, acquitted themselves well in their first firefight. All told, Longstreet's command suffered seventy casualties while inflicting eighty-three on the attackers. One member of the 17th was killed, with another eighteen wounded. Petty gazed on the corpse of the only fatality, Tom Sangster, of Alexandria. "A triumphant smile rested like a ray of sunshine upon his marble-like features," he commented. At least some of those casualties, Petty complained, were victims of friendly fire. Frightened men shot first and identified targets later. "Just say boo!" grumbled Petty the day after, "&amp; pop goes a gun at whoever is before them." </p><p> Petty himself witnessed no action that day. Off on an errand for his regimental commander, he returned after the fighting was done. Chagrined by his own absence, and perhaps a bit embarrassed, Petty extracted a promise from his colonel two days later that he could return to his company for the remainder of the campaign. Next time, he would not miss the fight. </p><p> Yet the next time, the true Battle of First Manassas on July 21, was even more embarrassing for Petty. Deployed as skirmishers in advance of the Rebel army, Petty and his captain were nearly captured. While running back to Rebel lines, they both stumbled and fell into Bull Run. As Petty plunged into the water, his musket slipped from his grasp. His body crashed into a rock just below the surface, bruising him badly, and as he rolled away, he knocked his captain back under. Completely saturated, the two struggled with each other and the current to stand once more. Hastily, Petty felt around for his weapon, without success. He was suddenly unarmed and in the midst of the largest battle yet fought on the North American continent. Petty limped back to Confederate trenches to secure another rifled musket. By the time he returned to the company, his captain had realized that Petty's bruise was severe enough to prevent him from moving quickly. He ordered the private back to camp. Petty hobbled off to a commanding hill, and from 11:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m., watched the battle from safety. The simultaneous roar of musketry and artillery from both sides must have stunned the green soldier. One eyewitness described it to his father by writing, "It was one continual thunder upon thunder until the Earth seemed to shake its very foundations." By very late afternoon, eruptions of gunfire slowly dissipated, and as darkness settled on the field, Petty returned to the trenches. </p><p> For Thomas Petty and many others, the start of the war was a comedy of errors, more slapstick than drama. His story is a useful reminder that any s...</p></p><h2>New York at War: Four Centuries of Combat, Fear, and Intrigue in Gotham</h2><p>the need to try.<p>Stretching from the colonial era to 9/11 and beyond, <i>New York at War</i> is that most rare of books: a work of history that is at once local and international, timely and timeless.

Jaffe's vividly written narrative restores a crucial thread to the way we understand the history of New York City.&nbsp;In a highly readable style, <i>New York at War</i> tells a story of tenacity and endurance, and of social conflict on a grand scale. With a story filled with drama and the drum-beat of violence, culminating with the destruction of the World Trade Center, Jaffe has much to tell us about the way a city responds to crisis.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Edward P.

But he's also good at spotting commonalities, the most intriguing being the way wars abroad become wars at home, with New York's polyglot citizenry battling over a conflict's legitimacy, or which combatant to back. Highly recommended.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Thomas Fleming, author of <i>1776: Year of Illusions</i></b><br> Anyone who's ever lived in New York, or visited it, or thought about visiting it will be fascinated by this book. &nbsp;Even historians will be surprised by some chapters.

Cannato, author of <i>American Passage: The History of Ellis Island</i></b><br> Too many New Yorkers have forgotten that their city had a long history of armed conflicts and violent attacks even before the attacks of 9/11.

Gripped by an overwhelming obsession, Charles Strickland, a conventional London stockbroker, decides in midlife to desert his wife, family, business, and civilization for his art. One of Maugham's most popular works, <i>The Moon and Sixpence</i> is a riveting story about an uncompromising and self-destructive man who forsakes wealth and comfort to pursue the life of a painter. Drifting from Paris to Marseilles, Strickland eventually settles in Tahiti, takes a mistress, and in spite of poverty and a long, terminal illness, produces his most passionate and mysterious works of art.<br>Loosely based on the life of Paul Gauguin, Maugham's timeless masterpiece is storytelling at its best &#x2014; an insightful work focusing on artistic fixation that propels the artist beyond the commonplace into the selfish realm of genius.</p><p>8 1-hour cassettesThis is the story of an artist who was willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of art. In much of its general outline, this famous novel follows the life of Paul Gauguin, famous French post-impressionist painter, but it is not a novelized biography of Gauguin. Rather it is a sharply delineated, carefully wrought "private life", written by one of the most vivid and penetrating contemporary literary masters.<p>Charles Strickland, the central character, was a stock broker in London. One day, at the age of forty, he left his business, his wife and their children and went to Paris. He had neither money nor prospects. He knew almost nothing of art. But he was seized with a passion to paint and for the rest of his life nothing else mattered to him. He gave up everything to which he had been accustomed for extreme poverty, social ostracism and the freedom to paint. When he finally died of leprosy in Tahiti, where he had gone native, the few paintings which turned up for sale brought only six to ten francs apiece. But he had achieved his desire to create beauty and with the years, the world fully recognized his blazing genius.</p></p><h2>High Low Split Poker for Advanced Players: Seven Card Stud and Omaha Eight or Better (Advance Player)</h2><p>The third book in the &#34;For Advanced Players&#34; series.

In fact, hedgerows are such an established part of our landscape that sometimes we take them for granted. Take a closer look, and the diversity and variety of plant species that form them is little short of wondrous. It is not only plant life that thrives in abundance in the hedgerow&#x2014;native wild animals, birds, and insects are protected and nourished by them. We know that at least 65 species of birds live in our hedgerows and that they are crucial to the survival of moths, bats, and dormice. In <i>The Hedgerow Handbook</i> Adele Nozedar reintroduces the wild and natural hedgerow ingredients that our grandmothers used on a regular basis&#x2014;but gives them a fresh and contemporary twist. From angelica to ash and bird cherry to borage, from pineapple weed to plantain and wild garlic to wimberries, each entry is accompanied by an exquisite full color illustration to help you identify each plant or flower, along with its history and folklore, and culinary and medicinal uses. You won't find yet another recipe for blackberry pie nor nettle soup here, however&#x2014;this is not your run-of-the mill hedgerow book. Instead, why not try Adele's Spicy Ash Key Pickle, her Beechnut Turron, Red Clover Lemonade, or Wild Raspberry Vodka? <i>The Hedgerow Handbook</i> is much more than a foraging book&#x2014;it is an inspiration and a trigger for a new experience of our countryside and for memories: of a summer filled with hot sunny days, or of the time you got drenched in a sudden rain shower miles away from the warmth and dryness of your car or home, which made those blackberry muffins even more enjoyable.</p><p><b>Adele Nozedar</b> is the owner of a remote residential recording studio in Wales, and two shops in Hay on Wye.

This system, if correctly followed, brings the initiate into contact with acausal energies and entities that are outside the realm of mundane experience. This is not an easy process, and not for the faint of heart. This volume presents several of the texts related to pathworking and sinister esotericism from the Hostia volumes, and adds to it the entire Sinister Tarot of ONA&#x2019;s Christos Beest.</p><p></p><h2>Dictionary of Newfoundland English: Second Edition</h2><p><p>The Dictionary of Newfoundland English, first published in 1982 to regional, national and international acclaim, is a historical dictionary that gives the pronunciations and definitions for words that the editors have called "Newfoundland English". The varieties of English spoken in Newfoundland date back four centuries, mainly to the early seventeenth century migratory English fishermen of Cornwall, Devon, Dorset and Somerset, and to the seventeenth to the nineteenth century immigrants chiefly from south-eastern Ireland. Culled from a vast reading of books, newspapers and magazines, this book is the most sustained reading ever undertaken of the written words of this province. The dictionary gives not only the meaning of words, but also presents each word with its variant spellings. Moreover, each definition is succeeded by an all-important quotation of usage which illustrates the typical context in which word is used. </p><p>This well-researched, impressive work of scholarship illustrates how words and phrases have evolved and are used in everyday speech and writing in a specific geographical area. The Dictionary of Newfoundland English is one of the most important, comprehensive and thorough works dealing with Newfoundland. Its publication, a great addition to Newfoundlandia, Canadiana and lexicography, provides more than a regional lexicon. In fact, this entertaining and delightful book presents a panoramic view of the social, cultural and natural history, as well as the geography and economics, of the quintessential lifestyle of one of Canada's oldest European-settled areas. This second edition contains a Supplement offering approximately 1500 new or expanded entries, an increase of more than 30 per cent over the first edition. Besides new words, the Supplement includes modified and additional senses of old words and fresh derivations and usages.</p></p><p><b>W.J.

This vividly detailed cultural history of L.A. from 1940 to 1970 traces the rise of a new suburban consciousness adopted by a generation of migrants who abandoned older American cities for Southern California's booming urban region. Eric Avila explores expressions of this new "white identity" in popular culture with provocative discussions of Hollywood and film noir, Dodger Stadium, Disneyland, and L.A.'s renowned freeways. These institutions not only mirrored this new culture of suburban whiteness and helped shape it, but also, as Avila argues, reveal the profound relationship between the increasingly fragmented urban landscape of Los Angeles and the rise of a new political outlook that rejected the tenets of New Deal liberalism and anticipated the emergence of the New Right. <br><br>Avila examines disparate manifestations of popular culture in architecture, art, music, and more to illustrate the unfolding urban dynamics of postwar Los Angeles. He also synthesizes important currents of new research in urban history, cultural studies, and critical race theory, weaving a textured narrative about the interplay of space, cultural representation, and identity amid the westward shift of capital and culture in postwar America.</p><p>"In Popular Culture in the Age of White Flight, Eric Avila offers a unique argument about the restructuring of urban space in the two decades following World War II and the role played by new suburban spaces in dramatically transforming the political culture of the United States. Avila's work helps us see how and why the postwar suburb produced the political culture of 'balanced budget conservatism' that is now the dominant force in politics, how the eclipse of the New Deal since the 1970s represents not only a change of views but also an alteration of spaces."&#x2015;George Lipsitz, author of <i>The Possessive Investment in Whiteness</i><b>Eric Avila</b> is Assistant Professor of Chicano Studies and History at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p><h2>Epitome of Copernican Astronomy and Harmonies of the World (Great Minds)</h2><p>The brilliant German mathematician Johannes Kepler (1571-1630), one of the founders of modern astronomy, revolutionized the Copernican heliocentric theory of the universe with his three laws of motion: that the planets move not in circular but elliptical orbits, that their speed is greatest when nearest the sun, and that the sun and planets form an integrated system. This volume contains two of his most important works: The Epitome of Copernican Astronomy (books 4 and 5 of which are translated here) is a textbook of Copernican science, remarkable for the prominence given to physical astronomy and for the extension to the Jovian system of the laws recently discovered to regulate the motions of the Planets.

Because all manufactured products are subject to variation, it is crucial that designers predict and understand how these changes can affect form, fit, and function of parts and assemblies&#x2015;and then communicate their findings effectively. </p> <p>Written by one of the developers of ASME Y14.5 and other geometric dimension and tolerancing (GD&amp;T) standards, <strong>Mechanical Tolerance Stackup and Analysis, Second Edition</strong> offers an overview of techniques used to assess and convey the cumulative effects of variation on the geometric relationship between part and assembly features. The book focuses on some key components: it explains often misunderstood sources of variation and how they contribute to this deviation in assembled products, as well as how to model that variation in a useful manner.</p> <p><strong>New to the Second Edition:</strong></p> <ul> <p> </p><li>Explores ISO and ASME GD&amp;T standards&#x2015;including their similarities and differences </li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>Covers new concepts and content found in ASME Y14.5-2009 standard</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>Introduces six-sigma quality and tolerance analysis concepts</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>Revamps figures throughout</li> <p></p></ul> <p></p> <p>The book includes step-by-step procedures for solving tolerance analysis problems on products defined with traditional plus/minus tolerancing and GD&amp;T. This helps readers understand potential variations, set up the problem, achieve the desired solution, and clearly communicate the results. </p> <p>With added application examples and features, this comprehensive volume will help design engineers enhance product development and safety, ensuring that parts and assemblies carry out their intended functions. It will also help manufacturing, inspection, assembly, and service personnel troubleshoot designs, verify that in-process steps meet objectives, and find ways to improve performance and reduce costs. </p></p><p><p><strong>Bryan R.

Emerging in early modern Europe to defuse violent religious conflict and reduce persecution, tolerance today is hailed as a key to decreasing conflict across a wide range of other dividing lines-- cultural, racial, ethnic, and sexual. But, as political theorist Wendy Brown argues in <i>Regulating Aversion</i>, tolerance also has dark and troubling undercurrents.</p><br><p> Dislike, disapproval, and regulation lurk at the heart of tolerance. To tolerate is not to affirm but to conditionally allow what is unwanted or deviant. And, although presented as an alternative to violence, tolerance can play a part in justifying violence--dramatically so in the war in Iraq and the War on Terror. Wielded, especially since 9/11, as a way of distinguishing a civilized West from a barbaric Islam, tolerance is paradoxically underwriting Western imperialism.</p><br><p> Brown's analysis of the history and contemporary life of tolerance reveals it in a startlingly unfamiliar guise. Heavy with norms and consolidating the dominance of the powerful, tolerance sustains the abjection of the tolerated and equates the intolerant with the barbaric. Examining the operation of tolerance in contexts as different as the War on Terror, campaigns for gay rights, and the Los Angeles Museum of Tolerance, Brown traces the operation of tolerance in contemporary struggles over identity, citizenship, and civilization.</p></p><p><p>"This is a brilliant book. Wendy Brown has made the reader understand 'tolerance' in a new and more provocative way. Alerting us to its genealogy, she demonstrates the ambiguity of any politics that seeks to found itself on this much-touted liberal virtue. <i>Regulating Aversion</i> is a remarkable--and remarkably rigorous--contribution to the considerable literature on tolerance and the limits of the tolerable. Anyone wanting to think seriously about multiculturalism, cosmopolitanism, and democratic pluralism in our time must read it."<b>--Talal Asad, CUNY Graduate Center</b></p><p>"Wendy Brown's <i>Regulating Aversion</i> is clear, rigorous, and unusually bold in an academic atmosphere that is now far from sympathetic to its kind of radical critique. Brown has done a wonderful job of orchestrating her argument, and it has been articulated with wit. The book is a worthy successor to her best and most politically astute contributions. This is an important work."<b>--Paul Gilroy, London School of Economics</b></p><p>"In this fascinating and provocative book, Brown brings into sharp analytical focus a perplexing phenomenon: in political discourse since the late twentieth century, both the objects and content of tolerance have shifted. The sweep of Brown's analysis is impressive: she deftly weaves together critiques of contemporary politics with thoughtful explorations of the history of liberal thought on tolerance."<b>--Melissa Williams, University of Toronto</b></p><b>Wendy Brown</b> is professor of political science at the University of California, Berkeley, where she is also a member of the Critical Theory Faculty.

Although the subject is essentially classical in nature, illustrative material is drawn widely from modern physics and free use is made of microscopic ideas to illuminate it. The overriding objective in writing the book was to achieve a clear exposition: to give an account of the subject that it both stimulating and easy to learn from. Classical thermodynamics has such wide application that it can be taught in many ways. The terms of reference for Equilibrium Thermodynamics are primarily those of the undergraduate physicist; but it is also suitable for courses in chemistry, engineering, materials science etc. The subject is usually taught in the first or second year of an undergraduate course, but the book takes the student to degree standard (and beyond).

It reprints the 1885 text of the first American edition (with a portfolio of illustrations) along with critical essays representing major critical and cultural controversies surrounding the work. The novel and essays are supported by distinctive editorial material &#x2014; including introductions to critical conflict in literary studies, to Twain&#x2019;s life and work, and to each critical controversy highlighted in this edition &#x2014; that helps students grapple not only with the novel&#x2019;s critical issues but also with cultural debates about literature itself. In addition to several new critical essays, the second edition includes an appendix on how to argue about the novel so that students may more effectively enter the critical conversation about its issues.</p><p>A seminal work of American Literature that still commands deep praise and still elicits controversy, <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> is essential to the understanding of the American soul. The recent discovery of the first half of Twain's manuscript, long thought lost, made front-page news. And this unprecedented edition, which contains for the first time omitted episodes and other variations present in the first half of the handwritten manuscript, as well as facsimile reproductions of thirty manuscript pages, is indispensable to a full understanding of the novel. The changes, deletions, and additions made in the first half of the manuscript indicate that Mark Twain frequently checked his impulse to write an even darker, more confrontational book than the one he finally published.Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

Rarely, however, do native communities benefit materially from this use of their heritage, a situation that drives growing resistance to what some denounce as "cultural theft."</p><p><i>Who Owns Native Culture?</i> documents the efforts of indigenous peoples to redefine heritage as a proprietary resource. Michael Brown takes readers into settings where native peoples defend what they consider their cultural property: a courtroom in Darwin, Australia, where an Aboriginal artist and a clan leader bring suit against a textile firm that infringes sacred art; archives and museums in the United States, where Indian tribes seek control over early photographs and sound recordings collected in their communities; and the Mexican state of Chiapas, site of a bioprospecting venture whose legitimacy is questioned by native-rights activists.</p><p>By focusing on the complexity of actual cases, Brown casts light on indigenous claims in diverse fields--religion, art, sacred places, and botanical knowledge. He finds both genuine injustice and, among advocates for native peoples, a troubling tendency to mimic the privatizing logic of major corporations.</p><p>The author proposes alternative strategies for defending the heritage of vulnerable native communities without blocking the open communication essential to the life of pluralist democracies. <i>Who Owns Native Culture?</i> is a lively, accessible introduction to questions of cultural ownership, group privacy, intellectual property, and the recovery of indigenous identities.</p></p><p>Michael F.

Rites and Passages places sailors at the center of a social history of whaling and explores the ways in which the history of the sea and the history of the shore have intersected. Drawing on the evidence of ship logs and sailors&#39; letters and journals, Margaret S. Creighton examines American whalemen during the industry&#39;s peak--the mid-nineteenth century--and argues that whaling life and culture were shaped by both the American mainland and by the exigencies of ocean life. Unlike other accounts of seafaring, this work brings gender into the maritime equation, not only with a discussion of the ways that women figured in this male-dominated world, but also with an examination of the ways that seafaring served as a rite of passage into manhood. Professor of History at Bates College, Margaret Creighton is the author of Dogwatch and Liberty Days: Seafaring Life in the 19th Century and co-editor of Iron Men and Wooden Women: Gender and Maritime History. She has been guest curator at The Peabody Museum of Salem and the U.S.S.

It argues that whaling life and culture were shaped by the American mainland as well as by the exigencies of ocean life.Rites and Passages presents a social history of American whaling. Drawing on the diaries of sailors and on ship logs, this volume examines the beliefs and behaviors of men who labored at sea. It looks at the relationship between sailors and society ashore, reexamines the &#34;tyrannical&#34; sea captain, and studies the social dynamics of the ship&#39;s company. In particular it considers the ways in which whalemen related to women and how seafaring served as a rite of passage into manhood. For more than a century the American public has understood whaling primarily through the work of a gifted man named Herman Melville. It is clear that other whalemen had tales to tell as well, and in Rites and Passages they share their compelling vision of life at sea.</p><h2>The Sociology of Mental Illness: A Comprehensive Reader</h2><p><em>The Sociology of Mental Illness</em> is a comprehensive collection of readings designed to help students develop a nuanced and sophisticated appreciation of the most important, heated--and fascinating--controversies in the field.<br><br>Drawing primarily from sociological sources, the text features both classical and contemporary selections that cover the full range of sociological topics, perspectives, and debates, including the social construction of mental illness, the social origins of mental illness, and contemporary mental health treatment.

The books on today's market are overly psychological, too brief, or too narrow to provide a full discourse of the sociological research and theory on this subject. I like McLeod and Wright's de-emphasis on disorder classification, reversing a major sociological failure of several competing books. I also like their emphasis on social construction approaches. This book can serve either as a stand-alone text or a companion book for courses in the sociology of mental health and illness.

In addition, an important theme is that teachers have overestimated how much vocabulary students really understand, and as a result, the so-called "comprehensible input" is neither comprehensible nor input.<br><br>The second language vocabulary acquisition myths reexamined in this book are:<br>*In learning another language, vocabulary is not as important as grammar or other areas.<br>*Using word lists to learn L2 vocabulary is unproductive.<br>*Presenting new vocabulary in semantic sets facilitates learning.<br>*The use of translations to learn new vocabulary should be discouraged.<br>*Guessing words from context is an excellent strategy for learning L2 vocabulary.<br>*The best vocabulary learners make use of one or two really specific vocabulary learning strategies.<br>*The best dictionary for L2 learners is a monolingual dictionary.<br>*Teachers, textbooks, and curricula cover L2 vocabulary adequately.<br></p><p></p><h2>Single Subject Research: Applications in Educational Settings</h2><p>This practical textbook provides background knowledge, basic concepts, and an understanding of relevant issues related to applied behavior analysis -- and specifically to single subject research designs.

He shows how, despite its elitist origins, humanism became a major force in the popular culture and fine arts of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and the powerful impact it had on both the Protestant and Catholic Reformations. He uses art and biographical sketches of key figures to illuminate the narrative and concludes with an account of the limitations of humanism at the end of the Renaissance.

Such discrepancies, Hilary Moss argues, suggest that white opposition to black education was not a foregone conclusion. Through the comparative lenses of these three cities, she shows why opposition erupted where it did across the United States during the same period that gave rise to public education.</p> <p>As common schooling emerged in the 1830s, providing white children of all classes and ethnicities with the opportunity to become full-fledged citizens, it redefined citizenship as synonymous with whiteness. This link between school and American identity, Moss argues, increased white hostility to black education at the same time that it spurred African Americans to demand public schooling as a means of securing status as full and equal members of society. Shedding new light on the efforts of black Americans to learn independently in the face of white attempts to withhold opportunity, <i>Schooling Citizens</i> narrates a previously untold chapter in the thorny history of America&#x2019;s educational inequality.</p> <p></p> <p></p></p><p><b>Hilary J. Moss</b> is associate professor of history and black studies at Amherst College.<p>&#x201c;In <i>Schooling Citizens</i> Hilary Moss makes a splendid contribution to the history of race relations in the antebellum period. Case studies of episodes in New Haven, Baltimore, and Boston illuminate crucial relationships between schooling, citizenship, and race. The cases require careful analysis because they defy easy generalizations about the legacy of slavery or regional differences. The result is a nuanced view of the attitudes that swirled around white opposition to black education in these years; what conditions, in contrast, fostered black education; and what was at stake for African Americans. The case-study approach lends itself to a wedding of intellectual history with turbulent social confrontation and thus animates this important study.&#x201d;</p> (Carl Kaestle, Brown University)<br><br><p>&#x201c;I cannot think of any other book that is like <i>Schooling Citizens</i>, which makes an important contribution both to the historiography of African Americans and to the history of education in America. Well-written and well-argued, this book is an original contribution to scholarship.&#x201d;</p> (Shane White, University of Sydney)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Hilary Moss has made a major contribution to our understanding of the links between race, citizenship, and schooling in the antebellum era. Using a wide range of sources, from African American newspapers to employment records to census data, this clear and compelling account shows how black communities in both the North and the South pursued education as a key to citizenship, only to confront whites who viewed educated blacks as a threat to their own standing in the American body politic. Drawing readers into the daily life of three racially diverse and dynamic cities, Moss illuminates the shortcomings&#x2014;and thus the deeper meanings&#x2014;of the &#x2018;common school crusade.&#x2019; Anyone who reads <i>Schooling Citizens</i> will be forced to grapple seriously with Moss&#x2019;s provocative assertion that, for some, the promise of schooling may have been a fiction from the start.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p> (Adam Nelson, University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison)<br><br>&#x201c;The historical events described in <i>Schooling Citizens</i> foreshadow many subsequent struggles over education and race. Hilary J. Moss clearly demonstrates that adding race to conversations about the history of American education reveals how inequity was embedded into public schools from the start. This well-researched and well-written volume brings together untapped records and a careful analysis of previously underutilized archival materials to reveal the long struggle for black educational equality. It is an important work that forces a reconsideration of America's commitment to universal education.&#x201d; (<i>Common-Place</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Hilary J. Moss offers an important corrective to the literature of the common schools by identifying race as a factor in their development. . . . With her detailed case examinations, Moss brings into focus the localized debates that contributed to the patchwork nature of American educational policy and provides awareness of both white and black activism surrounding integration that preceded <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> by more than a century.&#x201d;<br> (Ellen L. Berg <i>Journal of the History of Childhood and Youth</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Schooling Citizens</i> is a worthy contribution to the study of African- American struggles for access to education and schooling in the pre- Civil War era. . . . Hilary J. Moss asks us to ponder why Americans, both white and black, often believed in the democratic promise of schooling even though fair treatment and equal opportunity were so rarely realized.&#x201d; (William J. Reese <i>Journal of Interdisciplinary History</i>)<br><br><p>&#x2018;There has been an immeasurable amount of research done on the educational history of African Americans, but until recently little attention has been paid to the education of African Americans during the antebellum era, particularly in the North. Hilary J. Moss&#x2019;s evidentiary rich, meticulously researched, and masterfully written book is an important contribution on the subject. It illustrates the successes and challenges African Americans faced in primarily three locales&#x2014;New Haven, Baltimore, and Boston. . . . <i>Schooling Citizens </i>should be read by anyone interested in nineteenth-century race relations, social history, or the educational history of African Americans. It seeks to address an inherent contradiction in the mythology of American education&#x2014;that schools were accessible to all&#x2014;and it demonstrates the complications race played in questions related to not only citizenship and schooling but also the meaning of democracy itself.&#x201d;</p><p></p> (Christopher M.

Yet, the contemporary student of leadership often overlooks many of these names in favour of more recent theorists hailing from the social sciences. <i>Understanding Leadership: An Arts and Humanities Perspective</i> takes a different angle, employing the works of the great philosophers, authors and artists found in world civilization and presenting an arts and humanities perspective on the study of leadership.</p> <p></p> <p>The authors build their conceptual framework using The Five Components of Leadership Model, which recognizes the leader, the followers, the goal, the environmental context, and the cultural values and norms that make up the leadership process. </p> <p></p> <p>Supporting the text are a wealth of case studies which reflect on works such as Ayn Rand&#x2019;s novella <i>Anthem</i>, Eug�ne Delacroix&#x2019;s painting <i>Liberty Leading the People</i>, Charlie Chaplin&#x2019;s film <i>Modern Times</i>, Athol Fugard&#x2019;s play "<i>Master Harold" . . . and the Boys</i>, Lao Tzu&#x2019;s poetic work <i>Tao Te Ching</i>, and Anton�n Dvo&#x159;�k&#x2019;s <i>New World Symphony</i>.

Right now he is trying to contend with evil sorcery and win the tolerance, if not allegiance, of the emperor. Reinforcing him are two fugitive farm boys, Tad and Zane, and their mentor, Caleb, whose aid proves invaluable as all three youngsters mature, the farm boys with the additional help of another mage's daughters. The boys' growth entails some of Feist's most notable feats of characterization, feats that testify to the substantial improvement he has made as a writer during a career now approaching the 20-year mark.

Together with the well-known tales of &#39;Rapunzel&#39;, &#39;The Goose Girl&#39;, Sleeping Beauty&#39;, &#39;Hansel and Gretel&#39; and &#39;Snow White&#39;, there are the darker tales such as &#39;Death&#39;s Messengers&#39; which deserve to be better known, and which will appeal not only to all who are interested in the history of folklore, but also to all those who simply love good story-telling.</p><p>After studying at Marburg, Jacob became a clerk in the War Office at Kassel, and in 1808 librarian to Jerome Bonaparte, King of Westphalia. In 1841 he received Professorship at Berlin, and in 1854 began work on Deutsches Worterbuch with his brother.<br><br>Wilhelm Grimm (1786-1859) studied law in the early 1800s but became much better known as an accomplished and passionate storyteller and, with his brother Jacob, one of the Grimm Brothers, who gave the world the groundbreaking and fantastic collection of folklore, fairy stories, and fantasy tales we now call Grimm's Fairy Tales.<strong>'Among the few indispensable, common-property books upon which Western culture can be founded ... it is hardly too much to say that these tales rank next to the Bible in importance.'</strong> - <em>W.H. Auden</em></p><h2>The Antichrist</h2><p>The Antichrist is an in-depth study of who and what the Antichist is or will be. Arthur W. Pink traces all biblical references to the Antichrist including the Psalms, the Prophets, the Gospels, the Epistles, and Revelation. This provides us with a vivid image of the evil one as well as a window into the evil acts that he will perpetrate. A valuable eschatological reference book.</p><p><p>Except for Jesus Christ, the Antichrist will one day be the most powerful and influential person the world has ever known. His eventual demise into the lake of fire will be preceded by unfathomable evil, hypocrisy, and worldwide calamities. The son of Satan himself, this false messiah&#x2019;s masterful deception&#x2014;intended to destroy God&#x2019;s eternal plan&#x2014;will actually bring the plan of God to its much-anticipated climax. </p> <p>In this captivating study of Satan&#x2019;s false messiah, the author arranges biblical teaching on the Antichrist around his origin and identity, the time of his appearance, his work and doom, as well as tracing all references to him in the Psalms, the Prophets, the Gospels, the Epistles, and Revelation. This vivid biography of the Lawless One, the full embodiment of human wickedness, is an essential resource for the student of the Scriptures. </p> <p><em>&#x201c;A very capable synthesis of the biblical evidence surrounding the person and work of the Antichrist. A work of exceptional merit.&#x201d;</em></p> <p>&#x2014;Dr. Cyril J. Barber, The Minister&#x2019;s Library</p> <p><strong>Arthur W. Pink</strong> (1886-1952) was born and educated in England. He held pastorates in Australia and the United States, and authored numerous works, including <em>Gleanings in Genesis, Gleanings From Elisha, Gleanings From the Scriptures, </em>and<em> The Sovereignty of God</em>. </p>Arthur Walkington Pink (1886&#x2013;1952) was an English Christian evangelist and Biblical scholar known for his staunchly Calvinist and Puritan-like teachings. Pink was born in Nottingham, England on 1 April 1886 and became a Christian in 1908, at the age of 22. Though born to Christian parents, prior to conversion he migrated into a Theosophical society (the occult gnostic group which became precursor of the New Age movement, popular in England during that time), and quickly rose in prominence within their ranks. His conversion came from his father's patient admonitions from Scripture. It was the verse, Proverbs 14:12, 'there is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death,' which particularly struck his heart and compelled him to renounce Theosophy and follow Jesus. Desiring to grow in knowledge of the Bible, Pink emigrated to the United States to study at Moody Bible Institute. He left there after only two months and began his first pastorate in Silverton Colorado. In 1916 he married Vera E. Russell, who was from Kentucky. However, he left after just two months for Colorado, then California, then Britain. From 1925 to 1928 he served in Australia, including as pastor of two congregations from 1926 to 1928, when he returned to England, and to the United States the following year. He eventually pastored churches in Colorado, California, Kentucky, and South Carolina. In January 1922 he started a monthly magazine entitled Studies in the Scriptures which circulated among English-speaking Christians worldwide, though only to a relatively small circulation list of around 1,000. In 1934 Pink returned to England, and within a few years turned his Christian service to writing books and pamphlets. Pink died in Stornoway, Scotland on 15 July 1952. The cause of death was anemia. After Pink's death, his works were republished by a number of publishing houses, among them, Banner of Truth Trust, Baker Book House, Christian Focus Publications, Moody Press, Truth for Today, and reached a much wider audience as a result. Biographer Iain Murray observes of Pink, "the widespread circulation of his writings after his death made him one of the most influential evangelical authors in the second half of the twentieth century." His writing sparked a revival of expository preaching and focused readers' hearts on biblical living. Yet, even today, Pink is left out of most biographical dictionaries and overlooked in many religious histories.</p><h2>Reliance on the Light: Psychic Protection with the Lords of Karma and the Goddess</h2><p>Written for intermediate to advanced healers, RELIANCE ON THE LIGHT explains how to identify negative interference and create psychic protection in daily life through meditation and visualization.

The first book of a series." - Seira Wilson, Amazon Editor</p><p>JORDAN STRATFORD is a producer, author, and screenwriter. Stratford launched the idea for the Wollstonecraft Detective Agency series on Kickstarter, where the response was overwhelming enthusiasm.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mr. Stratford lives on Salt Spring Island in British Columbia, Canada, with his wife and children and is hard at work on the next book in the Wollstonecraft Detective Agency series.&#x201c;Force . . . equals . . . mass . . . times . . . acceleration,&#x201d; muttered Ada as she wrote in her notebook. Ada pondered that if you drop a hammer on your foot, it hurts more than dropping, say, a sock on your foot. The acceleration, or speeding up, is the same, but the mass, the solid oomph of a thing, is different. Oomph times zoom equals kaboom!<br><br>Ada and her pondering were cocooned in a square wicker box that resembled a giant picnic basket, just tall enough for her to stand up in and long enough for her to lie down in. Light entered through round, brass-�ringed windows and lit up stacks of books, rolls of paper, the odd screwdriver, and a bundle of pencils. The basket hung from thick ropes beneath a vast patchwork balloon that often swayed savagely in the wind, and the whole contraption was tethered with more ropes to the roof of Ada&#x2019;s Marylebone house in the heart of London.<br><br>The balloon was one of Ada&#x2019;s best inventions. It was filled with hot air from the house&#x2019;s many chimneys, which Ada funneled to it via numerous pipes bolted together. Taken as a whole&#x2014;�pipes, ropes, basket, and balloon&#x2014;�it gave the impression that the stately house was wearing a sort of ridiculous hat.<br><br>Ada lay stretched out on the gondola&#x2019;s floor in her favorite cherry velvet dress, which stopped a full inch above her ankles and showed wear and the odd black grease stain. Her hair was dark brown, almost black, and pulled back into a bun, with little wisps here and there trying to make a run for it.<br><br>What if, Ada wondered in her wicker box, you could accelerate a sock? What if the sock were moving so fast that it could have the same force as a hammer? Would it hurt the same? How fast would the sock have to go, and how could you make a sock go that fast?<br><br>Ada thought like this all the time. And to capture her thoughts, she made drawings&#x2014;�little sketches in notebooks or on scraps of paper or on table linens or, once (at a very dull picnic and much to the displeasure of her recently former governess, Miss Coverlet) on Ada&#x2019;s new dress. The drawing of the moment was a sock cannon of Ada&#x2019;s invention.<br><br>The sock cannon was taking shape on paper and in between Ada&#x2019;s ears. But as busy as her ears were containing the sock-�cannon plans, she could make out the sound of a carriage approaching the Marylebone house.<br><br>Grabbing a brass telescope that had been rolling about on the floor with the swaying of the basket, she stood and flipped open the hatch. She climbed up the three-�step rope ladder to the balloon&#x2019;s short deck, from which she could see as far as Oxford Street. She could see down Wimpole and Welbeck, Wesley and Westmoreland, down Weymouth and Cavendish and Queen Anne and even the little lanes off Baker Street. Only she and the crows knew her neighborhood in this way, from above.<br><br>Her stomach tightened. Walking across busy Marylebone Road, carpetbags in hand, went Miss Coverlet for the last time, leaving Ada alone for good.<br><br>Ada had to admit that &#x201c;alone&#x201d; was not entirely accurate. The house in London was staffed by two women whose names she could never quite remember: Misses Cabbage and Cummerbund, or possibly Arugula and Aubergine&#x2014;she honestly had no idea. When food arrived&#x2014;�with the exception of the bread and butter she&#x2019;d help herself to in the upstairs kitchen&#x2014;�it was at the hands of Miss Coverlet, or Ada&#x2019;s very tall and entirely silent butler, Mr. Franklin. And then the dishes went away, seemingly by themselves, to a place where she supposed something or other must happen to them.<br><br>But as far as Ada was concerned, without Miss Coverlet, whom Ada had known all her life, who had comforted her scrapes and answered her questions and fetched her favorite books and made sure her stockings weren&#x2019;t scratchy&#x2014;�something Ada hated rather desperately&#x2014;�yes, Ada would feel utterly alone.<br><br>At eleven, Ada was deemed too old for a governess, and was now to have a tutor instead. A tutor! Ada knew it was impossible for any living person to educate her. For that, she had her books. Books for learning, books for distraction, books for company, books for making sense of things. Ada&#x2019;s books were full of facts and figures, diagrams and calculations. Books that were not to be argued with. Books that stayed put when you needed them to and didn&#x2019;t run off to get married, as Miss Coverlet was off to do, which seemed to Ada like the stupidest idea ever.<br><br>In most matters, Ada was a genius. Once the facts and figures and charts and calculations from her books wandered into her head, they never left it. Even when she was a baby, Ada had loved number games and puzzles. She fixed things that were broken, and then began fixing things that weren&#x2019;t broken, or broke things so they could be fixed in ways no one else understood or found particularly convenient. But the one puzzle she couldn&#x2019;t solve was people. To Ada, they all seemed to be broken in ways she couldn&#x2019;t make sense of, and couldn&#x2019;t fix.<br><br>Right now there was the puzzle of her heart, which was breaking as Miss Coverlet stepped aboard the carriage.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to my balloon,&#x201d; Ada had said when informed of Miss Coverlet&#x2019;s departure that morning. She supposed that Miss Coverlet might have mentioned getting married before, but Ada hadn&#x2019;t realized that meant she&#x2019;d be leaving and that leaving meant alone. And she certainly hadn&#x2019;t known Miss Coverlet would be leaving today.<br><br>Ada knew that if she was to be alone, then the drawing room, with its grand wallpaper and curlicued gilt frames, its lush Indian carpet and scattering of delicate china, was not where &#x201c;alone&#x201d; was going to happen.<br><br>Miss Coverlet had watched Ada turn and leave, stomping just a little bit for show. Miss Coverlet had seen some very expert stomping from Ada over the years, and this stomping seemed halfhearted.<br><br>Indeed, as Ada now watched Miss Coverlet leave in the carriage, she felt that she had only half a heart left.<br><br>Ada had barely returned to her sock-�cannon plans when she heard the great black lion&#x2019;s-�head knocker strike the front door.<br><br>Whoever it was had best go away. She wanted to be left alone&#x2014;alone as Miss Coverlet had left her, here in her safe wicker fort beneath her balloon, tethered with strong nautical rope to the topmost peak of her house. While she knew she should slide down the rope to the widow&#x2019;s walk and swing into the attic window as she&#x2019;d done a hundred times before, she felt safest here, basket swaying, with her inventions and her books and her drawings. No, she would not come down.<br><br>Not ever.</p><h2>The Lion in the Lei Shop (Nancy Pearl&#x2019;s Book Lust Rediscoveries)</h2><p><p>Marty Langsmith is only five years old when a strange thunder rolls across the Hawaiian sky and life as she knows it explodes into flames.

The contributors bring a variety of theological and denominational perspectives to the subject, but they are united in their concern for the importance of the performance of the sermon--not in a shallow or theatrical sense but as an essential aspect of bringing God's Word to life for the congregation. To that end, these wide-ranging studies examine theological, artistic, and musical aspects of a compelling performance.<br><br>"Two of our finest teachers of preaching here collaborate on an invigorating book for preachers. Jesus doesn't mean for us to think about the gospel, even to understand the gospel. The gospel of Jesus Christ is meant to be enacted, embodied, and performed.

Personalities such as Elvis Presley, Oprah Winfrey, and Michael Jordan are more recognizable to many people than are most elected officials. <i>With Amusement for All</i> is the first comprehensive history of two centuries of mass entertainment in the United States, covering everything from the penny press to Playboy, the NBA to NASCAR, big band to hip hop, and other topics including film, comics, television, sports, dance, and music. Paying careful attention to matters of race, gender, class, technology, economics, and politics, LeRoy Ashby emphasizes the complex ways in which popular culture simultaneously reflects and transforms American culture, revealing that the world of entertainment constantly evolves as it tries to meet the demands of a diverse audience. Trends in popular entertainment often reveal the tensions between competing ideologies, appetites, and values in American society. For example, in the late nineteenth century, Americans embraced "self-made men" such as John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie: the celebrities of the day were circus tycoons P.T. Barnum and James A. Bailey, Wild West star "Buffalo Bill" Cody, professional baseball organizer Albert Spalding, and prizefighter John L. Sullivan. At the same time, however, several female performers challenged traditional notions of weak, frail Victorian women. Adah Isaacs Menken astonished crowds by wearing tights that made her appear nude while performing dangerous stunts on horseback, and the shows of the voluptuous burlesque group British Blondes often centered on provocative images of female sexual power and dominance. Ashby describes how history and politics frequently influence mainstream entertainment. When Native Americans, blacks, and other non-whites appeared in the nineteenth-century circuses and Wild West shows, it was often to perpetuate demeaning racial stereotypes&#x2015;crowds jeered Sitting Bull at Cody's shows. By the early twentieth century, however, black minstrel acts reveled in racial tensions, reinforcing stereotypes while at the same time satirizing them and mocking racist attitudes before a predominantly white audience. Decades later, Red Foxx and Richard Pryor's profane comedy routines changed American entertainment. The raw ethnic material of Pryor's short-lived television show led to a series of African-American sitcoms in the 1980s that presented common American experiences&#x2015;from family life to college life&#x2015;with black casts. Mainstream entertainment has often co-opted and sanitized fringe amusements in an ongoing process of redefining the cultural center and its boundaries. Social control and respectability vied with the bold, erotic, sensational, and surprising, as entrepreneurs sought to manipulate the vagaries of the market, control shifting public appetites, and capitalize on campaigns to protect public morals. Rock 'n Roll was one such fringe culture; in the 1950s, Elvis blurred gender norms with his androgynous style and challenged conventions of public decency with his sexually-charged performances. By the end of the 1960s, Bob Dylan introduced the social consciousness of folk music into the rock scene, and The Beatles embraced hippie counter-culture. Don McLean's 1971 anthem "American Pie" served as an epitaph for rock's political core, which had been replaced by the spectacle of hard rock acts such as Kiss and Alice Cooper. While Rock 'n Roll did not lose its ability to shock, in less than three decades it became part of the established order that it had originally sought to challenge. With Amusement for All provides the context to what Americans have done for fun since 1830, showing the reciprocal nature of the relationships between social, political, economic, and cultural forces and the way in which the entertainment world has reflected, refracted, or reinforced the values those forces represent in America.</p><p><b>LeRoy Ashby</b> is Regents Professor and Claudius O. and Mary Johnson Distinguished Professor of History at Washington State University.

As the children grew into their silent and difficult world, this palace became known as the Gang Mahal, or Dumb House. In his first novel, John Burnside explores the possibilities inherent in a modern-day repetition of Akbars investigations. The unnamed narrator creates a twisted variant of the Dumb House. When the children develop a musical language of their own, excluding their jailer, he extracts an appalling revenge.</p><p>Reader beware: <i>The Dumb House</i> is not for the faint of heart. This debut novel by Scottish poet John Burnside is subtitled <i>A Chamber Novel</i>, but "Chamber of Horror" might better describe it. The central character and narrator is Luke, a terrifyingly lucid madman with a hankering to "know the soul." His deceased mother told him once that the soul resided in language, and he's been obsessed ever since with discovering if this is true. To that end, Luke takes a page from an old fable about a king who kept babies sequestered in silent isolation in order to discover whether language is a natural or an acquired skill. For his own experiment, Luke impregnates a young stranger, takes the twins she gives birth to and locks them up in a basement where he raises them in complete silence. Eventually, however, the children begin to annoy him, and Luke feels he must "cut them down." How he does this isn't pretty.<p> From dissecting live animals as a boy to his latest outrage perpetrated on his own infant children, Luke is completely unconcerned with the sufferings of others, so intent is he on his "scientific" inquiries after the human soul. The fact that he is obviously lacking in this department is one of the book's ironies. The gruesome details are plentiful enough in Burnside's novel, but it is what goes on in the <i>mind</i> of this depraved character even more than what happens under his scalpel that terrifies; <i>The Dumb House</i> is likely to be one of those books that sticks in your memory long after it's done, whether you want it to or not.</p><b>John Burnside</b> is the author of&nbsp;<i>The Glister</i>; <i>Living Nowhere</i>; Something Like Happy, which was&nbsp;the Saltire Scottish Book of the Year; <i>A Summer of Drowning</i> which was shortlisted for the Costa Prize; and <i>Black Cat Bone</i>, which won both the Forward Prize and the T.S.

Sorachi made his manga debut with the one-shot story DANDELION, which is included in volume 1 of the GIN TAMA graphic novels.</p><h2>The Secret Adversary</h2><p>The Secret Adversary is the second published detective fiction novel by Agatha Christie, first published in January 1922 in the United Kingdom by The Bodley Head and in the United States by Dodd, Mead and Company later in that same year. The book introduces the characters of Tommy and Tuppence who feature in three other Christie novels and one collection of short stories; the five Tommy and Tuppence books span Agatha Christie&#39;s writing career. The Great War is over, and jobs are scarce. Tommy Beresford and Prudence &#34;Tuppence&#34; Cowley meet and agree to start their own business as The Young Adventurers. They are hired for a job that leads them both to many dangerous situations, meeting allies as well, including an American millionaire in search of his cousin. Reviews were generally positive on this adventure, which manages to keep the identity of the arch-criminal secret to the very end. Upon publication of the first book edition it was reviewed by The Times Literary Supplement in its edition of 26 January 1922, which described it as &#34;a whirl of thrilling adventures&#34;. It stated that the characters of Tommy and Tuppence were &#34;refreshingly original&#34; and praised the fact that the &#34;identity of the arch-criminal, the elusive &#34;Mr. Brown&#34;, is cleverly concealed to the very end&#34;. The critic for The New York Times Book Review (11 June 1922) was also impressed: &#34;It is safe to assert that unless the reader peers into the last chapter or so of the tale, he will not know who this secret adversary is until the author chooses to reveal him.&#34; The review gave something of a backhanded compliment when it said that Christie &#34;gives a sense of plausibility to the most preposterous situations and developments.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>The Radical Enlightenment - Pantheists, Freemasons and Republicans</h2><p>When first published in 1981, &#34;The Radical Enlightenment&#34; encountered both praise and blame.

In 1954 she was charged with sedition by McCarthy-style politicians who played on fears of communism to preserve southern segregation. Though Braden remained controversial&#x2015;even within the civil rights movement&#x2015;in 1963 she became one of only five white southerners whose contributions to the movement were commended by Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in his famed "Letter from Birmingham Jail." Braden's activism ultimately spanned nearly six decades, making her one of the most enduring white voices against racism in modern U.S. history. Subversive Southerner is more than a riveting biography of an extraordinary southern white woman; it is also a social history of how racism, sexism, and anticommunism intertwined in the twentieth-century South as ripples from the Cold War divided the emerging civil rights movement.</p><p>Anne McCarty Braden is a southern white woman who made a dramatic break with her native, segregationist culture in the years just following World War II to commit her life to the causes of racial and social justice. One of the few white people--particularly from the South--to join the southern black freedom movement in its nascent years in the 1950s, Braden became a role model and inspiration for the thousands of young white people that joined the mass movement a decade later. Braden&#39;s life has intersected on some level with most of the great social movements of her lifetime, and represents a central link that connects the southern protest movements of the 1930s and 1940s to the mass civil rights movement of the 1960s. Fosl not only shares the extraordinary life of Braden with her readers, but also teaches them about the struggles that white southern activists had to face in the segregated, Cold War South.Winner of the 2003 Oral History Association Book Award <p>Winner of the 2003 Gustavus Myers Center for Human Rights Outstanding Book Award</p></p><h2>Double Vision Quilts: Simply Layer Shapes &amp; Color for Richly Complex Curved Designs</h2><p>Learn how to turn squares and rectangles into circles and ovals with no curved piecing&#x2015;it's easy!

You'll be able to make visually stunning quilts. Follow the instructions for no curved piecing. There are 11 quilt projects to practice layering, texture, colour and pattern to produce vibrant designs. This book looks at shape, values, colour selection, machine applique, embellishing, finishing and hanging. Apart from the fabulous projects there is also a gallery. I am definitely going to have a go at this, got a few ideas myself. It's certainly a new slant on quilting. The only draw back I can see is that I think it takes even more fabric. My favourite projects are the ones on the front and back cover. Highly recommended. (<i>yarnsandfabrics.co.uk, 7/26/16</i>)<br><br>Art quilter and quilting teacher Smith (coauthor, One-Patch Plus) demonstrates her technique for curved quilt designs in this workshop-style book. Rather than using traditional curved patchwork piecing, Smith takes a layered approach, presenting both fusible and nonfused options. The terminology&#x2015;Smith refers to circles or convex pieces as "HUGs" and concave pieces as "KISSes"&#x2015;takes some getting used to, but her playful items are surprisingly easy to construct using her expert guidance. As with most art quilting, embellishment and color choices are key, and Smith provides ample direction in both areas. Each project includes full guidelines and an at-a-glance overview of both the difficulty and the construction technique. Art quilters interested in optical illusion-style quilts or quilts using curved pieces such as circles or ellipses will appreciate Smith's practical and engaging guide.

(<i>Quilter's Connection, Fall 2016</i>)<br><br>Well-known author and art quilter Louisa L.

(<i>Machine Quilting Unlimited, September/October 2016</i>)<br><br>Creating complex-looking, multicolored curved patterning is easy as can be with these clever fabric-layering techniques. Twelve projects with full-size templates provide a great way to experiment with the detailed methods, and a variety of resulting shapes and color interplay. Finishing options are included, as well as basic quilt-making techniques. (<i>American Quilt Retailer, October 2016</i>)<br><br>This is a book that appealed to my eye first, the rich colours used on the front cover demanded to be looked at more closely. It was almost put down as quickly as I had picked it up when I saw the word 'curved designs' as I am not a great lover of curves, but this book has made me think again and I am itching to try the techniques. Louisa calls her innovative method 'Double Vision' and it consists of clever cutting and layering of fabric to create curves in a very easy way. The book is divided into sections, each one explaining the technique in more detail, making recommendations about colours and fabrics and adding stitch and other embellishment. The 11 projects are suited to more contemporary patterned and coloured fabrics and the quilts are more of an art quilt than a bed quilt so this may not appeal to all. Louisa's double vision method along with the kisses and hugs&#x2015;all will become clearer if you read the book&#x2015;started as a doodle made on a car journey. From this simple drawing of circles in squares grew a way of sewing without curves and making stunning art quilts. I am already delving in my stash and thinking of the colours I will use in my own double vision quilt. (<i>Popular Patchwork, November 2016</i>)<br><br>Louisa L. Smith has a simple premise for this book: creating layered and complex quilts from circles and the negative spaces created by them within a block.In the theoretical section, she explores some of the fundamentals of colour theory and a very useful Proportionate Colour Wheel shows the strength of the primary and secondary colours, recommending how to balance colours in your work. Many of the examples are included later in the book as quilt projects.The quilts are made up of layers of different methods of construction. By building up the circles, the negative space shapes become shapes in their own right. In this way, the quilts created are like optical illusions, with parts popping out into the foreground or fading into the background. By using such simple, limited tools, a great variety of results is gained.By using hand-dyed and printed fabrics in addition to commercial ones, the detail in the quilts is increased. Templates are provided at the back of the book but if you wanted to take a shortcut, cutting dies or patterns on digital cutting machines are usually available (see Products in this issue for further exploration of this). This book has a beautiful gallery of work so there's enough to keep you interested in the variety of designs or to get you started in tackling your own.

For George Palmer-Jones and the other avid crew members achieve every bird-watcher&#39;s dream when they sight a sea bird which has never before been recorded. In the subsequent excitement, however, no one notices the sudden absence of the most fanatical birder of them all . . . Later, Greg Franks&#39; corpse, the head bludgeoned, is found floating in the sea. Had it not been for Greg Franks, amateur detective George Palmer-Jones would not have been on the bird watching trip in Cornwall in the first place. He had been hired by Greg Franks&#39; anxious parents to try and persuade their errant son to return home. George would have turned the case down flat but the offer of a free weekend&#39;s bird watching was too tempting to resist. Now, he must unhappily shoulder the burden of finding why the young man had been murdered. Who hated Franks enough to kill him?

However, at the town graveyard, Huck and Tom witness a murder, carried out by local vagabond Injun Joe. They vow never to tell a soul about what they have seen and so begins their journey into adulthood as Tom wrestles with his own morality, guilt and anxiety.</p><p>A &#x2018;coming of age&#x2019; tale, it is through Tom&#x2019;s adventures and relationships with others that he becomes more responsible and more aware of his own inner conflict.

Beginning with an explanation of how she reclaimed her artistic impulses, this book invites readers to explore their own resources for creativity. With a�step-by-step approach to personal development in the tradition of Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain and The Artist&#x2019;s Way, it teaches not only the technical skills needed to draw but also ways to delve into our inner lives for healing and inspiration. The book is divided into three sections: Pencils and Perception (observing and drawing what is seen in the physical world); Crayons and Consciousness (drawing the interior landscape); and Ink and Intuition (drawing on one&#x2019;s intuitive wisdom). With 300 black-and-white illustrations, this is an easy, fun way to unlock creativity and unleash the spirit.</p><p>This book represents over 30 years of my life and took three years to write. I use and teach Drawing as a Sacred Activity as one way to help myself and my students to find balance in a changing world. When you engage drawing as the sacred activity it is meant to be, you become an explorer with an open heart and an open mind. You, like each one of us, looks out at the world through your own point of view and because your view of the world is totally unique you have a certain responsibility to become more aware of the many different influences that color your point of view. The drawing exercises in this book are designed to help you get to know yourself inside and out. Clearly, drawing is a powerful and natural way for everyone to find balance, create meaning, discover purpose, explore feelings, and experience the wonder and fulfillment that life offers to each and every one of us. As an added bonus, you also produce something tangible to share your journey with family, friends, and community! And finally, because Life is Eternal and Infinite in Essence, there is no fence limiting the discoveries you can make through drawing. Thank you for reading these words and contemplating the value of drawing as a sacred activity in your own life.Williams combines her natural teaching abilities (she's a California high school instructor) with a lifetime devoted to art in this encouraging guide. Readers are urged to find sanctity in their drawing. Many exercises explore expressing feelings by drawing with the nondominant, less intellectual hand. Williams emphasizes, perhaps too frequently, that readers should be patient and gentle with themselves during their artistic explorations, and she reminds all-thumbs aspirants that "there's nothing wrong with stick figures." This accepting book is packed with dozens of exercises and hundreds of evocative drawings, thus favorably recalling Julia Cameron's The Artist's Way. Not to be used as an instructional drawing guide, this is recommended for all self-help collections.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Every Storm (Contemporary Romance)</h2><p><p>New from Lori Wick, this stand-alonestory shows how unexpected changes can set the perfect course for love. </p> <p><i>1945, WWII--</i>When Lieutenant Donovan Riggs experiences trouble with his PT boat, the sailors of <i>Every Storm </i>make an unscheduled stop...and a surprising discovery.</p> <p>Lorraine Archer is an American teacher living and working in Australia.

The United States of Europe, the new nation formed by an alliance between the Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus and the West Virginians hurled back in time by a cosmic accident, is on the verge of civil war. His brain injured in the war with Poland, the USE's emperor Gustavus Adolphus is no longer in command. Enter Swedish chancellor Oxenstierna, a leader of aristocratic reaction against democracy. His goal: to assemble the forces of the hidebound ruling class in Berlin and drown the revolution in a bloodbath. <br> <br> In Magdeburg, the capital of the USE, Mike Stearns' wife Rebecca Abrabanel is organizing popular resistance to Oxenstierna's plot.

He finished reading a particularly bad novel, threw it across the room, and declared, "I can write better than that."

David lives in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.Germany, 1636. The USE&#x2014;the United States of Europe&#x2014;is still in its shaky birthing years. The mysterious appearance of a twenty-first-century American town (Grantville, West Virginia) in seventeenth-century Germany caused a major uproar, but an alliance with Gustavus Adolphus, the king of Sweden, allowed the displaced Americans to forge a new nation, the USE. But now, a few years later, Adolphus has been marginalized, and his successor, the stoutly antidemocratic Axel Oxenstierna, the Swedish chancellor, is hungry for power and has set his sights on the USE. Byron Chieske, the &#x201c;up-time&#x201d; American cop, and his &#x201c;down-time&#x201d; partner, Gotthilf Hoch, are concerned that some recent cases of sabotage and murder might only be the beginning of a much larger plot. This is the fourteenth book in the Ring of Fire series, and familiarity with previous stories is, if not essential, at least strongly recommended. Series fans, though, can expect to jump right in and pretty much spend the next 560 pages glued to their chairs.

Written in the form of a diary by the leader of a group of five revolutionaries, the novel provides a straightforward and clinical account of the assassination and contains daring and vivid descriptions of the revolutionary underground and political conspiracy. Savinkov gives free reign to his dramatic impulses, the &#x201c;inner feelings&#x201d; of the conspirators, and the moral dimension of the plot.

Draped in tattered clothing, I was part of a long line of refugees who looked beaten and hopeless shuffling through the destruction. I felt the heat from flames erupting from storefront windows. Blackened and wrecked vehicles littered the street and sidewalks. The dreary procession veered around a smoldering upturned delivery truck in the middle of the boulevard.<br> <br>I couldn&#x2019;t believe how my once-beautiful downtown Bayport had been transformed into a postapocalyptic wasteland. Just a week ago, everything was normal. Winslow Pharmacy&#x2019;s huge plate-glass windows were intact instead of in shattered pieces all over the sidewalk. The Dollar Hut was full of shoppers and without flames erupting from the front doors. Sickly sweet instrumental music filled the air in Sal&#x2019;s Diner rather than the buzzing of downed electrical wires. All this mayhem happened in just a short week. Right after they came to town.<br> <br>&#x201c;Unreal,&#x201d; whispered my brother, Joe, as he lumbered along next to me. His blond hair was almost black, and his face was covered in soot and ash. Like everyone else, Joe wore ripped, threadbare clothing. &#x201c;I never thought I&#x2019;d see Bayport like this.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No kidding,&#x201d; I murmured.<br> <br>I glanced around at the long line of refugees, many of whom I knew. I spotted some of my classmates and friends, including Eric Watts, Amanda Paul, and Hector Cruz. Even my chemistry teacher, Mr. Watson, wore a torn and stained blue blazer. Mrs. Sally Gertz, owner of Sal&#x2019;s Diner, didn&#x2019;t even look up as she passed her smoking restaurant.<br> <br>All of a sudden we heard a scream.<br> <br>Something was happening at the back of the procession. Then, another scream. This one was closer. Everyone picked up the pace. I looked back to see a commotion in the distance. The people at the end of the line were pushing forward, running from something.<br> <br>&#x201c;You think we&#x2019;ll see them from here?&#x201d; asked Joe.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; I replied. My stomach knotted with excitement. I knew I was supposed to be frightened, but part of me wanted to see our pursuers, couldn&#x2019;t wait to catch a glimpse of them.<br> <br>More screams, even closer. The sounds of terror were mixed with primal grunts and growls. Everyone around me moved faster, and I found I had to jog to keep up with the pack. Yet I couldn&#x2019;t help glancing over my shoulder for a glimpse of the creatures terrorizing them. Terrorizing us!<br> <br>This time I caught flashes of them. Not so far behind us I saw biting teeth and skeletal claws swiping at the crowd. It was a good thing I looked back.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh!&#x201d; cried Mrs. Gertz as she stumbled and fell to the ground.<br> <br>I spun around and pushed against the charge of frightened people. All the while the screams and growls grew louder. When I reached Mrs. Gertz, I slipped behind her to shield her from the oncoming crowd. The screams surrounded us, and the rush tripled to a panicked stampede. Grabbing her arms, I helped the woman to her feet.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you, Frank,&#x201d; she said with a smile. Then her eyes focused on something over my left shoulder. She shrieked and then dashed into the raging river of refugees.<br> <br>Something clamped onto my left shoulder. I spun around to find myself face-to-decomposing-face with . . . a zombie!<br> <br>Milky-white eyes stared back at me through pronounced eye sockets. Gray skin stretched over bony cheekbones and pulled away from grinning yellow teeth. Black liquid oozed over its bottom lip as its mouth opened wide, ready to take a bite.<br> <br>I felt another one grasp my right arm. It jerked me away just as the first undead creature lunged forward. I stumbled away from the first zombie and spun to confront the second. But luckily, it wasn&#x2019;t a zombie&#x2014;just Joe.<br> <br>&#x201c;You want to be a zombie snack?&#x201d; asked Joe.<br> <br>&#x201c;No way!&#x201d; I replied.<br> <br>I stumbled into a run as Joe and I followed the fleeing refugees. A glance back showed a horde of the undead in pursuit. They moved faster than I expected; a few almost kept pace with the escaping mass of Bayport citizens.<br> <br>This was amazing! Despite the chaos, I couldn&#x2019;t help smiling with delight.<br> <br>A loud burst of static filled the air.

The discovery of this mysterious person, soon christened Judah, sets the town scrambling for answers as its most prominent citizens weigh in on whether he is man or beast, blessing or curse, miracle or demon. Though Judah is a shocking addition, the town of Paradise Deep is already full of unusual characters. King-me Sellers, self-appointed patriarch, has it in for an inscrutable woman known only as Devine&#x2019;s Widow, with whom he has a decades-old feud. Her granddaughter, Mary Tryphena, is just a child when Judah washes ashore, but finds herself tied to him all her life in ways she never expects. <i>Galore </i>is the story of the saga that develops between these families, full of bitterness and love, spanning two centuries.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Paradise Deep, award-winning novelist Michael Crummey imagines a realm where the line between the everyday and the otherworldly is impossible to discern. Sprawling and intimate, stark and fantastical, <i>Galore </i>is a novel about the power of stories to shape and sustain us.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, April 2011</strong>: Out of the belly of a whale, Michael Crummey pulls the marvelous story of Paradise Deep, a remote settlement on the northern Newfoundland coast, a place "too severe and formidable, too provocative, too extravagant and singular and harrowing to be real," teeming with fierce rivalries, affections, and loyalties spanning five intertwined generations. His tale opens in a hungry winter, when a beached humpback arrives as an unexpected gift and the townspeople convene to claim their piece. From a slit in its gut spills a man--white, mute, and eerily alive--who assumes a central role in the lineage of the Divine family. Alternately feared as a devil and revered as a healer, Judah fathers a fish-scented son with the raven-haired Mary Tryphena. Their family comprises the heart of the town's rich mythology, with all its ghosts, mermaid trysts, strange accidents, miraculous babies, and impossible loves, rendered in language so gorgeously raw, it will transport you to a land whose sky is "alive with the northern lights, the roiling seines of green and red like some eerily silent music to accompany the suffering below." --<i>Mari Malcolm</i><b>Michael Crummey </b>is a poet and storyteller, and the author of the critically acclaimed novels <i>River Thieves </i>and <i>The Wreckage </i>and the short story collection <i>Flesh and Blood. </i>He has been nominated for the Giller Prize, the IMPAC Dublin Award, and Rogers Writers&#x2019; Trust Fiction Prize, and won the Commonwealth Writers&#x2019; Prize for Canada for <i>Galore. </i>He lives in St. John&#x2019;s, Newfoundland.</p><h2>Dictionary of Poetic Terms</h2><p>Formerly <i>The Longman Dictionary of Poetic Terms</i>, this newly updated version contains over 1,600 entries on the devices, techniques, history, theory, and terminology of poetry from the Classical period to the present.

Fortunately, a family friend gave her some invaluable advice-make a list of what you love to do, and let that be your guide. Gail wrote down four words:<br><br> Eat. Write. Travel.

Contrary to stereotype, he says, it is the farmers and their colonizing descendants&#x2015;ourselves&#x2015;who are the true nomads, doomed to the geographical and spiritual restlessness embodied in the story of Genesis. By contrast, the hunters have a deep attachment to the place and ways of their ancestors that stems from an enviable sense, distinctively expressed in thought, word, and act, of being part of the fabric of the natural and spiritual worlds.</p></p><p>Praise for The Other Side of Eden <p>"Hugh Brody's The Other Side of Eden is an indispensable book. It creates a haunting symphony: part philosophy, part linguistics, part eulogy, it informs our deepest sensibilities as few books can. While Brody exquisitely ranges throughout history and the world at large, The Other Side of Eden is perhaps most a kind of documentary film of the soul of the Arctic, Brody's personal heartland. Nobody - nobody - writes better about the northern reaches of our planet ... Brody is absolutely fearless in his thinking, bold in his writing, generous in his knowledge and love of existence itself." --Howard Norman </p><p>"Hugh Brody has written a learned, eloquent, and mysteriously moving introduction to the enduring culture of hunter-gatherers. But none of these adjectives does justice to the deeply transformative experience of reading The Other Side of Eden, which led me beyond the limits of familiar mythology, introduced me to people whose lives are radically different from my own, and reminded me, at the same time, that different as they are, hunter-gatherers are an essential piece of my humanity and I cannot truly understand myself without them." --Jonathan Rosen </p><p>"A terrific read ... In part a fascinating memoir of Hugh Brody's decades of living with and working on behalf of native hunting and gathering peoples ... it is more importantly an examination of the ways in which freedom and intimacy with both family and location intersect in those cultures. Thus it offers us a model we ought to consider very seriously when setting out to rethink our own acquisitive, confrontational, divisive, warlike, and destructive ways." --William Kittredge </p><p>"Penetrating meditation on traditional societies caught in the avalanche of modern times, and on the gentle infusion of the holistic vision, not only in regard to life and death, but in such quotidian concerns as good manners and the care of children. Wonderful!" --Peter Matthiessen </p><p> "In this wondrous book, Hugh Brody takes us on many journeys - to the Arctic Circle and the origins of humanity, and deeper yet into the mysteries of language and culture, dreams and colonialism. By doing so with trans-lucid originality, he provides readers with the chance to question how their own modern lives are organized and, more crucially, what we must re-imagine about the past and the future if we are to survive as a truly thinking species." --Ariel Dorfman</p><p><b>Hugh Brody</b> is an anthropologist and documentary filmmaker who has worked and traveled extensively among indigenous peoples.

Has the Great Disruption of recent decades rent the fabric of American society irreparably? In this brilliant and sweeping work of social, economic, and moral analysis, Francis Fukuyama shows that even as the old order has broken apart, a new social order is already taking its place. <i>The Great Disruption</i> forges a new model for understanding the Great Reconstruction that is under way.</p><p>Francis Fukuyama cements his reputation as a wide-ranging public intellectual with this big-think book on social order and human nature. Following his earlier successes (<i>The End of History and the Last Man</i> and <i>Trust</i>), Fukuyama argues that civilization is in the midst of a revolution on a par with hunter-gatherers learning how to farm or agricultural societies turning industrial. He finds much to celebrate in this cultural, economic, and technological transformation, but "with all the blessings that flow from a more complex, information-based economy, certain bad things also happened to our social and moral life." Individualism, for example, fuels innovation and prosperity, but has also "corroded virtually all forms of authority and weakened the bonds holding families, neighborhoods, and nations together." Yet this is not a pessimistic book: "Social order, once disrupted, tends to get remade again" because humans are built for life in a civil society governed by moral rules. <p> We're on the tail end of the "great disruption," says Fukuyama, and signs suggest a coming era of much-needed social reordering. He handles complex ideas from diverse fields with ease (this is certainly the first book whose acknowledgments thank both science fiction novelist Neal Stephenson and social critic James Q. Wilson), and he writes with laser-sharp clarity.

Makes you see the world differently.&#x201d;&#x2015;<em>Washington Post</em></strong></p> A modern classic that uses historical analysis to shed light on the present, <em>The Future of Freedom</em> is, as the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> put it, "essential reading for anyone worried about the promotion and preservation of liberty." Hailed by the <em>New York Times</em> as "brave and ambitious...updated Tocqueville," it enjoyed extended stays on the <em>New York Times, Wall Street Journal</em>, and <em>Washington Post</em> bestseller lists and has been translated into eighteen languages. Prescient in laying out the distinction between democracy and liberty, the book now contains a new afterword on the United States's occupation of Iraq. <p>"Intensely provocative and valuable," according to <em>BusinessWeek</em>, with an easy command of history, philosophy, and current affairs, <em>The Future of Freedom</em> calls for a restoration of the balance between liberty and democracy and shows how politics and government can be made effective and relevant for our time.</p></p><p>Fareed Zakaria has been called &#34;the most influential foreign policy adviser of his generation&#34; (Esquire). He is the Emmy-nominated host of CNN&#39;s Fareed Zakaria GPS, contributing editor for The Atlantic, a columnist for the Washington Post, and the best-selling author of The Post-American World and The Future of Freedom. He lives in New York City.This provacative book is written by NEWSWEEK columnist and television commentator Fareed Zakaria. Ned Schmidtke's fine reading is even-paced and clear and fits well with the material. While his voice is not particularly dynamic, it is appropriate for the text. Zakaria challenges conventional wisdom on the link between economic and political liberalism and political democracy. He traces the development of liberalism and democracy in a host of countries around the world and then turns to questions about the functioning of democracy in America, ultimately challenging some of our assumptions about democracy always being the best form of government.

And from here, how those early roots flourished through hard work and dedication to a successful (but never easy) career in food writing and a much wider world, from working for pizza roll king Jeno Paulucci to researching food traditions in Finland and appearing with Julia Child and Martha Stewart&#x2014;all without ever leaving behind the lessons learned on the farm.

I've always felt a greater sense of renewal at the beginning of September than I ever have in January. Perhaps, I thought as I crossed Tranquil Vale, it's because September so often feels fresh and clear after the dankness of August. Or perhaps, I wondered as I passed Blackheath Books, its windows emblazoned with Back to School promotions, it's simply the association with the new academic year.<br><br>As I walked up the hill towards the Heath, the freshly painted fascia of Village Vintage came into view and I allowed myself a brief burst of optimism. I unlocked the door, picked the mail up off the mat, and began preparing the shop for its official launch.<br><br>I worked nonstop until four, selecting the clothes from the stockroom upstairs and putting them out on the racks. As I draped a 1920s tea dress over my arm I ran my hand over its heavy silk satin, then fingered its intricate beading and its perfect hand stitching. This, I told myself, is what I love about vintage clothes. I love their beautiful fabric and their fine finish. I love knowing that so much skill and artistry have gone into their making.<br><br>I glanced at my watch. Only two hours to go until the party. I remembered that I'd forgotten to chill the champagne. As I dashed into the little kitchen and ripped open the cases I wondered how many people would come. I'd invited a hundred, so I'd need at least seventy glasses at the ready. I stacked the bottles in the fridge, turned it up to Frost, then made myself a quick cup of tea. Sipping my Earl Grey, I looked around the shop, allowing myself to savour for a moment the transition from pipe dream to reality.<br><br>The interior of Village Vintage looked modern and light. I'd had the wooden floors stripped and limed, the walls painted a<br><br>dove grey and hung with large silver-framed mirrors; there were glossy potted plants on chrome stands, a spangling of downlights on the white- painted ceiling, and next to the fitting room, a large cream- upholstered berg�re sofa. Through the windows, Blackheath stretched into the far distance, the sky a giddying vault of blue patched with towering white clouds. Beyond the church, two yellow kites danced in the breeze while on the horizon the glass towers of Canary Wharf glinted and flashed in the late-afternoon sunlight.<br><br>I suddenly realised that the journalist who was supposed to be interviewing me was over an hour late. I didn't even know which paper he was from. All I could remember from yesterday's brief phone conversation with him was that his name was Dan and that he'd said he'd be here at three-thirty. My irritation turned to panic. What if he didn't come at all? I needed the publicity. My insides lurched at the thought of my huge loan. As I tied the price tag on an embroidered evening bag, I remembered trying to convince the bank that its cash would be safe.<br><br>"So you were at Sotheby's?" the lending manager had said as she went through my business plan in a small office, every square inch of which, including the ceiling and even the back of the door, seemed to be covered in thick, grey baize.<br><br>"I worked in the textiles department," I'd explained, "evaluating vintage clothes and conducting auctions."<br><br>"So you must know a lot about it."<br><br>"I do."<br><br>She scribbled something on the form, the nib of her pen squeaking across the glossy paper. "But it's not as though you've ever worked in retail, is it?"<br><br>"No," I said, my heart sinking. "That's true. But I've found attractive, accessible premises in a pleasant, busy area where there are no other vintage dress shops." I handed her the real estate agent's brochure for Montpelier Vale.<br><br>"It's a nice site," she said as she studied it. My spirits rose. "And being on the corner gives it good visibility." I imagined the windows aglow with glorious dresses. "But the lease is expensive." The woman put the brochure down on the grey tabletop and looked at me grimly. "What makes you think you'll be able to generate enough sales to cover your overhead, let alone make a profit?"<br><br>"Because . . ." I suppressed a frustrated sigh. "I know that the demand is there. Vintage has now become so fashionable that it's almost mainstream. These days you can even buy vintage clothing in High Street stores like Miss Selfridge and Topshop."<br><br>There was silence while she scribbled again. "I know you can." She looked up again, but this time she was smiling. "I got the most wonderful Biba fake fur in Jigsaw the other day-mint condition and original buttons." She pushed the form towards me, then passed me her pen. "Could you sign at the bottom there, please?" . . .<br><br>Now I arranged the evening gowns on the formal-wear rack and put out the bags, belts, and shoes. I positioned the gloves in their basket, the costume jewellery in its velvet trays, then, on a corner shelf, high up, I carefully placed the hat that Emma had given me for my thirtieth birthday.<br><br>I stepped back and gazed at the extraordinary sculpture of bronze straw, its crown seeming to sweep upwards into infinity.<br><br>"I miss you, Em," I murmured. "Wherever you are now . . ." I faltered as I felt the familiar piercing sensation, as though there was a skewer in my heart.<br><br>I heard a sharp rapping sound behind me. On the other side of the glass door stood a man of about my age, maybe a little younger. He was tall and well built with large grey eyes and a mop of dark blond curls. He reminded me of someone famous, but I couldn't think who.<br><br>"Dan Robinson," he said with a broad smile as I let him in. "Sorry to be a bit late." I resisted the urge to tell him that he was very late. He took a notebook out of his battered-looking bag. "My previous interview ran overtime, then I got caught in traffic, but this should only take twenty minutes or so." He shoved his hand into the pocket of his crumpled linen jacket and produced a pencil. "I just need to get down the basic facts about the business and a bit of your background." He glanced at the hydra of silk scarves spilling over the counter and the half-dressed mannequin. "But you're obviously busy, so if you haven't got time, I'd quite-"<br><br>"Oh, I've got time," I interrupted. "Really-as long as you don't mind me working while we chat." I slipped a sea-green chiffon cocktail dress onto its velvet hanger. "Which paper did you say you were from?" Out of the corner of my eye I registered the fact that his mauve striped shirt didn't go with the sage of his chinos.<br><br>"It's a new twice-weekly free paper called the Black &amp; Green-the Blackheath and Greenwich Express. It's only been going a couple of months, so we're building our circulation."<br><br>"I'm grateful for any coverage," I said as I put the dress at the front of the day-wear rack.<br><br>"The piece should run on Friday." Dan glanced round the shop. "The interior's nice and bright. You wouldn't think it was old stuff that was being sold here-I mean, vintage," he corrected himself.<br><br>"Thank you," I said wryly, though I was grateful for his observation.<br><br>As I quickly scissored the cellophane off some white agapanthus, Dan peered out the window. "It's a great location."<br><br>I nodded. "I love being able to look out over the Heath. Plus the shop's very visible from the road, so I hope to get passing trade as well as dedicated vintage buyers."<br><br>"That's how I found you," said Dan as I put the flowers into a tall glass vase. "I was walking past yesterday, and your sign said"-he reached into the pocket of his trousers and took out a pencil sharpener-"that you were about to open, and I thought it would make a good feature for Friday's paper." As he sat on the sofa I noticed that he was wearing mismatched socks-one green and one brown. "Not that fashion's really my thing."<br><br>"Isn't it?" I said politely as he gave the pencil a few vigorous turns. "Don't you use a tape recorder?" I couldn't help asking.<br><br>He inspected the newly pointed tip, then blew on it. "I prefer speed writing. Okay now." He pocketed the sharpener. "Let's start. So . . ." He bounced the pencil against his lower lip. "What should I ask you first?" I tried not to show my dismay at his lack of preparation. "I know," he said. "Are you local?"<br><br>"Yes." I folded a pale blue cashmere cardigan. "I grew up in Eliot Hill, closer to Greenwich, but for the past five years I've been living in the centre of Blackheath, near the station." I thought of my snug railwayman's cottage with its tiny front garden.<br><br>"Station," Dan repeated slowly. "Next question . . ." This interview was going to take ages-it was the last thing I needed. "Do you have a fashion background?" he asked. "Won't the readers want to know that?"<br><br>"Er . . . possibly." I told him about my fashion-history degree from Saint Martin's and my career at Sotheby's.<br><br>"So how long were you at Sotheby's?"<br><br>"Twelve years." I folded an Yves Saint Laurent silk scarf and laid it in a tray. "In fact I'd recently been made head of the costumes and textiles department. But then . . . I decided to leave."<br><br>Dan looked up. "Even though you'd just been promoted?"<br><br>"Yes . . ." My heart ached. I'd said too much. "I'd been there almost from the day I'd graduated, you see, and I needed . . ." I glanced out the window, struggling to quell the surge of emotion breaking over me. "I felt I needed . . ."<br><br>"A career break?" he suggested.<br><br>"A . . . change. So I went on a sort of sabbatical in early March." I draped a string of Chanel paste pearls round the neck of a silver mannequin. "Sotheby's said they'd keep my job open until June, but in mid-May I saw that the lease here had come up, so I decided to take the plunge and sell vintage myself. I'd been toying with the idea for some time," I added.<br><br>"Some . . . time," Dan repeated quietly. This was hardly "speed writing." I stole a glance at his odd squiggles and abbreviations. "Next question . . ." He chewed the end of his pencil. The man was useless. "I know: Where do you find your stock?" He looked at me. "Or is that a trade secret?"<br><br>"Not really." I fastened the hooks on a caf� au lait-coloured silk blouse by Georges Rech. "I bought quite a bit from some of the smaller auction houses outside London, as well as from specialist dealers and private individuals who I already knew through Sotheby's. I also got things at vintage fairs, on eBay, and I made two or three trips to France."<br><br>"Why France?"<br><br>"You can find lovely vintage garments in provincial markets there-like these embroidered nightdresses." I held one up. "I bought them in Avignon. They weren't too expensive because French women are less keen on vintage than we are in this country."<br><br>"Vintage clothing's become rather desirable here, hasn't it?"<br><br>"Very desirable." I quickly fanned some 1950s copies of Vogue onto the glass table by the sofa. "Women want individuality, not mass production, and that's what vintage clothing gives them. Wearing vintage suggests originality and flair. I mean, a woman can buy an evening dress on High Street for two hundred pounds," I went on, warming to the interview now, "and the next day it's worth almost nothing. But for the same money she could have bought something made of gorgeous fabric, that no one else would have been wearing and that will, if she doesn't wreck it, actually increase in value. Like this." I pulled out a Hardy Amies petrol-blue silk taffeta dinner gown, from 1957, admiring its elegant halter neck, slim bodice, and gored skirt.<br><br>"It's lovely," said Dan. He cocked his head. "You'd think it was new."<br><br>"Everything I sell is in perfect condition."<br><br>"Condition . . ." he muttered as he scribbled again.<br><br>"Every garment is washed or dry-cleaned," I went on as I returned the dress to the rack. "I have a wonderful seamstress who does the big repairs and alterations. The smaller ones I can do here myself-I have a little den in the back with a sewing machine."<br><br>"And what do these things sell for?"<br><br>"They range from fifteen pounds for a hand-rolled silk scarf, to seventy-five for a cotton day dress, to two or three hundred pounds for an evening dress. A couture piece can cost up to fifteen hundred pounds." I pulled out a Pierre Balmain gold faille evening gown from the early 1960s, embroidered with bugle beads and silver sequins, and lifted its protective cover. "This is an important dress, made by a major designer at the height of his career. Or there's this." I took out a pair of silk velvet palazzo pants in a psychedelic pattern of sherbety pinks and greens. "This outfit's by Emilio Pucci. It'll almost certainly be bought as an investment piece rather than to wear, because Pucci, like Ossie Clark, Biba, and Jean Muir, is very collectable."<br><br>"Marilyn Monroe loved Pucci," Dan said. "She was buried in her favourite green silk Pucci dress." I nodded, surprised and not liking to admit that I hadn't known that. "Those are fun." He glanced at the wall behind me. Hanging on it, like paintings, were four strapless, ballerina-length evening dresses-one lemon yellow, one candy pink, one turquoise, and one lime-each with a satin bodice beneath which foamed a mass of net petticoats, sparkling with crystals.<br><br>"I've hung those there because I love them. They're fifties prom dresses, but I call them cupcake dresses," I added with a smile, "because they're so glamorous and frothy. Just looking at them makes me feel happy." Or as happy as I can be now, I thought bleakly.<br><br>Dan stood up. "And what's that you're putting out there?"<br><br>"This is a Vivienne Westwood bustle skirt." I held it up for him. "And this"-I pulled out a terra-cotta silk kaftan-"is by Thea Porter, and this little suede shift is by Mary Quant."<br><br>"What about this?" Dan had pulled out an oyster-pink satin evening dress with a cowl neckline, fine pleating at the sides, and a sweeping fishtail hem. "It's wonderful-it's like something Katharine Hepburn would have worn, or Greta Garbo-or Veronica Lake," he added thoughtfully, "in The Glass Key."</p><h2>Talking Back to the Bible: A Historian&#39;s Approach to Bible Study</h2><p>In a fascinating rumination, Edward G.

The author concludes that it is most important for human beings to affirm a God with whom they can have a relationship. Having relationships with others is a human need. The Bible, it turns out, is the record of human beings documenting their relationship with God.&nbsp; This opens up a new way of reading the Bible. When human beings read the Bible they are engaging in an ongoing conversation.&nbsp; As in all relationships, there is give and take, talking to and talking back, asking and listening, becoming closer and at times pulling farther apart.&nbsp; <br><br>Dr.Andrea Croce Birch<br>Dean,College of Fine Arts and Humanities<br>Dean,Undergraduate School<br>Professor of Philosophy<br>Brenau University <br>&nbsp;<br>When I was a child, I would get in into trouble talking back to my parents.

The story line sheds new light on aspects of familiar verses that I have tended to overlook when delving into scripture from a homiletical perspective. I appreciated how the writer infused personal testimony with impactful insight to help make the text even more meaningful to contemporary life. This is truly a remarkable text that has reminded me not to limit how we approach the various ways in which we study the Bible.

In 38 chapters that he calls conversations, Simmons offers his take on various topics that he examines in light of their historical context. His study can be controversial at times,especially for readers from more-conservative backgrounds, with chapters titled "Did Jesus Use a Bathroom?" "Why Jesus Wasn't a Christian," and"Can God be Trusted?" But the author believes that asking these sorts of questions and measuring them against the historical context will allow the reader to go deeper into a personal understanding of God and the Bible. Simmons argues that viewing Jesus through modern glasses results in different, more useful interpretations. When examining Jesus in the context of what people believed at the time, for example, Jesus becomes more human (with all the attendant temptations of humanity) and a man with a mission rather than a messiah. Although it is somewhat scattered, the book offers fresh perspectives on everything from passages about Daniel's visions to modern worship.

His slightly husky upper-register voice is calm and assured, and he knows exactly where to pause, provide emphasis, and how to deliver a punch line. While Gladwell is not a seasoned reader and sometimes needs to vary his pitch and rhythm, he seems to relish bringing to light the ideas and people he finds fascinating.

In these stories, Animal Man is called by S.T.A.R. Labs to investigate a break-in related to an AIDS vaccine, only to learn what inhumane acts are going on.

On sea, in the air, and on land our boys fought against totalitarian powers that threatened to overturn the American ideal of liberty for every individual, even civilization itself.<br><br>But while often forgotten, America&#x2019;s women participated too. On the home front they were more than willing to share in the hardships of wartime, and in countless cases they fairly lived and breathed with support for our troops overseas. Whether working in factories or taking care of families, rationing or volunteering, their unflagging support contributed more to our victories than has ever been told.<br><br>Young people have been falling in love since time began, but romance during a global conflagration brought a unique set of challenges. The uncertainty of the time led to an abundance of couples marrying quickly, after brief courtships.

It was the worst time at all to try to have a relationship; yet amazingly, thousands of couples created lifelong bonds.<br><br>From blind dates to whirlwind romances to long separations, War Bonds highlights stories of couples who met or married during WWII. Each of the 30 stories begins with a World War II-era song title and concludes with a look at wartime couples in their twilight, as well as when they were so hopeful and young and determined to save the world. Illustrated with photographs from the 1940's as well as current ones of each couple, War Bonds offers readers a glimpse of bygone days, as well as a poignant glimpse of our own.<br><br>During history&#x2019;s greatest war it was no time to start a relationship.

Her &#x201c;Front Porch&#x201d; column offers humorous, often poignant commentary about life, love and raising sons&#x2013; not necessarily in that order. In addition, her stories have been published in numerous magazines and anthologies including seven volumes of the Chicken Soup For the Soul series. Cindy is the mother of four sons ages 25 to 15 and is owned by two cats, also boys. She and her husband, Derek, recently celebrated their 28th anniversary. Surprisingly, she actually finds cooking for her busy family relaxing. Daily walks provide inspiration and much needed quiet time. Her idea of heaven is a room full of books and all the time in the world to read them."War Bonds eloquently tells the stories of the love for the 'girl back home' which sustained and gave courage to so many young men during times of great peril. A must read for any romantic." (Tony Lamanna, director of Inland Northwest Honor Flight)<br><br>"Mrs. Hval is a first-rate professional writer. War Bonds should be a bestseller, and not only a bestseller but a long-term seller." (Patrick F. McManus, New York Times best-selling author of the Bo Tully mysteries.)<br><br>"War Bonds is more than an introduction to World War II history. Every story in this collection fairly resonates with that mysterious kind of love we all hope to find&#x2014;the kind that conquers and heals and lasts forever."

Put in the context of war, and that war, made history come to life &#x2013; no longer history, but actual life....Love, love the love lessons &#x2013; and the photos in between. I spent the majority of the time with tears in my eyes, imagining this or that. It takes a true storyteller to create that kind of connection. Cindy Hval is that kind of storyteller.&#x201d; (Beth Mary Bollinger, author, &#x201c;Until the End of the Ninth)<br><br>"In 2008, when journalist Hval was sent by her editor at the Spokesman-Review of Spokane, Wash., to collect WWII-era love stories, she did not expect her initial skepticism to give way to admiration, or readers to also fall for the stories. Out of Hval&#x2019;s reportage come 35 moving stories of couples who married or first met during WWII. Each selection takes its title from a song of the era, such as &#x201c;Have a Little Faith&#x201d; and &#x201c;Little Things Add Up to Love.&#x201d; In one of the most affecting tales, &#x201c;The Luck of the Draw,&#x201d; we meet an Englishwoman, Violet, who, despite telling her sister not to &#x201c;get mixed up with an American&#x201d; as they were &#x201c;a little too friendly,&#x201d; herself fell for one, Fenton. As with many of the couples depicted here, he shipped out to war not long after their 1944 meeting, but not before successfully proposing marriage; they married the next year, both wearing their uniforms. Each chapter includes photographs of the bride and groom either at the beginning of their unions or just before, as well as more recently; dates are given for anyone who has since passed away.

The love stories of the couples featured in this book have stood the test of time , under the most difficult situations, leaving the reader spellbound. These stories brought to the fore by Cindy Hval, are true stories of how some extremely brave and loving couples, who were married at the onset of World War II, will help us to remember the lives of our parents or grandparents during that time when you never knew whether this would be the last time you ever saw some of your loved ones." (<i>Feathered Quill Book Review</i>)<br><br>"War Bonds is truly a heartwarming read, one that will renew your faith in commitment and marriage itself." (<i>Best of World War II Blogspot</i>)<br><br>"World War II shaped a generation in numerous ways, but perhaps none so poignant as are revealed in this series of 36 stories of how love can be birthed and endure for a lifetime in the midst of a world-wide cataclysm.

As satisfying a primer on fishing as any angler could wish, it celebrates the art and spirit of fishing with verse, song and folklore, moral reflections, and timeless wisdom. Cast in the form of a dialogue between the veteran angler Piscator and his pupil Viator, it both informs and delights with an ingenious exploration of fishing's subtle intricacies and the pleasures of the natural world.</p><p>For a book to stay in print for nearly 350 years, its merits must continually entice and satisfy. <i>The Compleat Angler</i> qualifies on both counts. On the most obvious level, it remains as good a primer on fishing as any angler would want. But its most enduring distinction is hinted at in the subtitle--"the Contemplative Man's Recreation." Izaak Walton's sometimes convoluted 17th-century grammar can still reel in our imaginations with his graceful evocations of a life free from hurly-burly in the company of friends intent on physical and moral sustenance. "He that hopes to be a good Angler must not only bring an inquiring, searching, observing wit," suggests the master, "but he must bring a large measure of hope and patience.... Doubt not but Angling will prove to be so pleasant, that it will prove to be like a virtue, a reward to itself." Just like Walton's magnificent literary catch. --<i>Jeff Silverman</i>[[The first unabridged cast reading. Features original song compositions.

This fascinating history of ideas also explores the influence&nbsp;the monastic cell had on one of society&#x2019;s darkest experiments in silence: Eastern State Penitentiary.

This collection, a meditative extension of that answer, draws from philosophy, art, literature, mythology, anthropology, film, and other fields, as well as Johnson&#x2019;s personal experience, to consider how our ideas about justice might be expanded beyond vengeance and retribution to include acts of compassion, patience, mercy, and grace.<br> <br> From &#x201c;Speak Truth to Power,&#x201d; about the condition of not being believed about rape and assault; to &#x201c;Goliath,&#x201d; about the concept of evil; to &#x201c;Girlhood in a Semi-Barbarous Age,&#x201d; about the sacred feminine, &#x201c;ideal woman,&#x201d; and feminist art, Johnson creates masterful, elaborate, gorgeously written essays that speak incisively about our current era.

She is sitting near the door in the last row of the auditorium, having spent the last hour listening to me talk about what it means to have once been kidnapped and raped by a man I loved, a man with whom I lived, a man who even before the kidnapping had already violated me in every way you might imagine possible, especially if you were a man like him. Someone else in the audience asks what happened to the man, and I explain how he got away, how he is a fugitive living in Venezuela, raising a new family. This is not the ending anyone expects.<br> <br>Now the woman has a question. She raises her hand, and when I call on her, always last, she stands and speaks in a clear, assertive voice: &#x201c;What do you want to have happen to him, to the man who did this to you?&#x201d; By &#x201c;this&#x201d; I know she means not only the actual crime the man committed but also all of the therapy, the nightmares and panic attacks, the prescribed medication and self-medication, the healing and self-harm. &#x201c;I mean, you probably want him dead, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>No, I think. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; I say out loud. Her expression crumples; she looks confused. Everyone in the audience looks confused. This isn&#x2019;t supposed to be how the story ends; it&#x2019;s not the ending they want for themselves, for me.<br> <br>The women at the book club don&#x2019;t want this ending either. They are sitting around a long oak dining table in the home of our gracious host, who brings food out in many courses, during each of which the wine flows freely. They ask questions, mostly bookish ones, but eventually the conversation turns to the man I lived with, to how he got away.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d kill him for you,&#x201d; one says.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d kill him on the spot,&#x201d; says another.<br> <br>They carry guns in their purses, they have told me. Maybe they are angry enough to use them.<br> <br>One brings up a story she heard earlier in the day: a local man has been convicted of a boy&#x2019;s murder. The boy was seven when the local man raped him; he turned eight on the day the local man burned him alive. The boy survived long enough to implicate the man, who was charged with capital murder after the boy died. He was tried, convicted, and sentenced to forty years in prison.<br> <br>&#x201c;Justice has been served,&#x201d; one of the women in the book club says.<br> <br>&#x201c;How is this justice?&#x201d; asks another. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s going to spend the next forty years living off our taxes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He should be burned alive,&#x201d; the host says, &#x201c;the same way he tried to kill that boy.&#x201d;<br> <br>She has been quiet the entire evening, in and out of the kitchen, up and down from her chair. Now she is seated at the head of the table, looking at her hands, which twist and untwist an ironed napkin over the middle of her plate. &#x201c;What do you want to have happen to him?&#x201d; she asks me.<br> <br>This woman, like every other woman who asks the question, sits with her back to the wall, like I do when I have the choice, or near the door in the last row of every auditorium. Sometimes she is my mother&#x2019;s age, or my age: she wears oversized sweaters, little makeup, pulls back her hair in a simple bun. She does not want attention. She has children, like I do, and like I do, she sometimes struggles to love them well. She will tell me this after I have finished answering questions, when I am sitting at a little table signing books. She has a story that is similar to mine &#x201c;in ways,&#x201d; and she doesn&#x2019;t even know what to feel about it anymore.<br> <br>Sometimes the woman sitting near the door, or against the wall, is an old woman with crepe paper hands. Sometimes she is not a woman but a man&#x2014;an old man my father&#x2019;s age in a ten-gallon hat, who tells me he was raped by an uncle when he was the age of my son. Or the person who asks the question is a man young enough to be my son if I had started much earlier, who tells me the question is for himself, or for his girlfriend. They both have a story like mine, he says, and they have not yet found an ending to it. I am surprised at how the people sitting near the door in the last row of the auditorium always have a story like mine.<br> <br>I carry these stories with me because I don&#x2019;t know what else to do with them. The details may differ. If it is not the story of an abusive lover, perhaps it is a mother, or a father, or an uncle; or it is the story of a friend who has been killed by a stranger while trying to do the right thing, or a woman who is shot in the back of the head while asking for help; it might be a story about the abuse of power, or authority, of the slow violence of bureaucracy, of the way some people are born immune from punishment and others spend whole lifetimes being punished in ways they did nothing to deserve.<br> <br>In my story, there was a man I once loved very much, and because of the self-destructive way in which I loved him, I didn&#x2019;t want to leave him when he abused me first with his words and then with his fists. I told myself I could fix him. That this wasn&#x2019;t who he was, not really. I let him keep showing me who he really was until I finally believed him and left.<br> <br>I had already lived a few lives by that time, I thought&#x2014;a farm girl from Missouri, a door-to-door steak salesperson, a sex worker, a model in New York, a survivor of domestic violence and sexual assault&#x2014;but I was afraid none of these lives had sufficiently prepared me to live the one I wanted more than anything else. I had only just begun thinking of myself as a writer around that time, but I told myself I had probably not read enough books, had not visited enough continents, was not smart enough or wise enough, didn&#x2019;t have anything to say, and no one would want to hear it if I did. I thought there had been a mistake in the cosmic register. Somewhere there was another Lacy Johnson who could keep straight when to use lay instead of lie, who actually belonged in all the places I began finding myself, who deserved all the good things that suddenly seemed to be happening to me.<br> <br>This is all to say that the worst violence that man committed was not against my body but against the story I told about the person I believed myself to be.<br> <br>I was twenty-one when that man kidnapped and raped me and tried, but failed, to kill me. The man got away, and I got away; he is a fugitive living in Venezuela, and I am a writer of books. The last one I wrote was about him, about the day he meant to kill me but I lived. It was not easy, not the writing and not the living&#x2014;not until I often found myself standing in front of strangers telling them there is justice for me in standing here, in this room, alive and breathing and telling my story with my own voice.<br> <br>It is not the ending to the story anyone expects&#x2014;not even the one they want, because they want a return, a redemption, a retrieval of all I had lost for my part in the story; they want suffering for him. They want blood, guts, gore.<br> <br>Now that would be justice, they think.<br> <br>My mom tells me she wants him dead. She has just read the book&#x2014;even though I told her not to, even though she told me she wouldn&#x2019;t. She, like the woman sitting at the head of the table in the book club and like the woman sitting near the door in the last row of the auditorium, feels unsatisfied by the story I have told about my life, because it cannot be reconciled to all she has been told about how these things should end: that the man who did the terrible thing should suffer as much as I have suffered, and as much as she has suffered, if not more. In all of the movies she has seen, this is how it goes: the person who has done a terrible thing falls from a very tall building, or is incinerated in a ball of white-hot flames, or is shot in the dark by police, or at the very least is led away in handcuffs. She wants an ending like that for herself, for me.<br> <br>I also watch these movies on occasion, and I admit there is a certain satisfaction when Uma Thurman&#x2019;s Beatrix Kiddo finally kills Bill on the patio of his villa with the five-point exploding heart technique. He knows what he has done, why she has come; he does not even try to stop her. I take pleasure watching Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander condemn her rapist by tattooing that word into his chest. She violates him in the same ways he violated her, and a few more for good measure. When Sophie Turner&#x2019;s Sansa Stark allows Ramsay&#x2019;s own dogs to eat him alive, she smiles a little, and there is something in me that smiles also. These men deserve this punishment, the stories tell us, and it feels good to see someone get what he deserves.<br> <br>I know this is spectacle, entertainment, not actual life, though life also has its share of spectacles. I would be horrified, find I often am, to see anyone actually murdered, much less tortured, out of some thirst for revenge. The spectacle reinforces over and over a story I want to believe about the world even though I have never yet witnessed it for myself: that everything will come out right in the end, that bad things eventually happen to bad people, that good people eventually receive all the blessings they deserve. Everyone gets their just desserts, the story tells me so I can go on.<br> <br>But what if that doesn&#x2019;t happen? What if, as in my story, the person who does the terrible thing more or less gets away with it? Does that mean there is no justice to be had or made or found? What does justice look like in a situation where the crime is not intimate and personal but massive and public, and there is no one person to blame? What if the wrong person is blamed? What if we punish the right person but in the course of doing so cause unnecessary pain? What if we ourselves feel pain by performing this duty of punishing person after person, day after day? How could we not? What does justice look like in these situations? Is justice even a &#x201c;real&#x201d; thing that any of us can achieve at all?<br> <br>There is a story we have each heard from birth that when someone does something bad, something bad should happen to that person in return and that this turnabout is justice. This story is a very old one, I&#x2019;ve learned, older even than the law of an eye for an eye we find in the Old Testament, traceable back to the pre-Babylonian period, to the Code of Hammurabi, the oldest surviving record of ancient law:<br> <br>If a man has put out the eye of a free man, put out his eye.<br> <br>If he breaks the bone of a free man, break his bone.<br> <br>If he puts out the eye of a serf, or breaks the bone of a serf, he shall pay one mina of silver.<br> <br>This is the lex talionis&#x2014;the law of retaliation&#x2014;written more than five thousand years ago when vengeance ran amok, when a man might steal his neighbor&#x2019;s cow, for instance, and the neighbor would respond by murdering that neighbor&#x2019;s entire family. As we tell it now, the lex talionis is mandate&#x2014;you must put out his eye&#x2014;but the law was in fact meant to put a limit on vengeful action, to curb what humans understood to be our baser instincts.<br> <br>Then, as now, we want to transform our suffering: to take a pain we experience and change it into the satisfaction of causing pain for someone else. We watch Clint Eastwood as Josey Wales turn his grief into hatred in order to pick up a gun, and watch Ving Rhames as Marsellus Wallace turn his terror and near annihilation into the promise of &#x201c;going medieval&#x201d; on his rapists, and us as his audience into accessories to all the suffering this promise might mean.<br> <br>&#x201c;To see another suffer is pleasant,&#x201d; Nietzsche writes; &#x201c;to make another suffer is still more pleasant.&#x201d; He&#x2019;s thinking in particular of how tempting it is to imagine punishment as a kind of redemption for guilt&#x2014;the German word shuld means both &#x201c;guilt&#x201d; and &#x201c;debt,&#x201d; and one primary meaning of the word redemption was to buy that debt back&#x2014;a trick of the mind that tells us that every injury has some equivalent of pain or sacrifice. There is, as Nietzsche points out, a strange accounting in this: a crime creates a debt; the criminal becomes a debtor, the victim his creditor, whose compensation is the particular pleasure of bearing witness to a cruel and exacting punishment.<br> <br>Is that justice? Would I cheer, and cry, and jump up and down if the man who kidnapped and raped me were kidnapped and raped, and beaten, if I could grind him down with my rage until there was almost nothing left of him? If I could watch him suffer in all the ways he made me suffer or, better yet, cause that suffering myself? The story tells me to imagine it would feel satisfying: a release of adrenaline or perhaps the relief from it. Catharsis: a cleansing. To be honest, I&#x2019;m not sure what justice is supposed to feel like. There is a shut place I carry inside me. If I caused him to suffer, would that go away?<br> <br>I have found photographs of him on the Internet that suggest he is living with a woman who has given birth to two of his children, both girls. In the photos, he is as unhappy in his new life as he ever was in the one he lived with me. On vacation, he grows sullen because the trip isn&#x2019;t going his way, and when the family joins him in the ocean he frowns and looks away from the camera, afraid of being recognized, of what the photograph will reveal. The older daughter, who is the same age as my son, sits on her mother&#x2019;s lap, the mother who is love and safety, who makes a wall with her body between the daughter and him. Does he notice she does this? He holds the baby a little above his lap and away from his body. At a party, he dances back and forth in front of the children, and also their parents who are watching, because he has an audience, and in public he performs a version of himself who is charming, who is fun to be around, who is everything anyone ever wanted a person to be. Behind closed doors, he is angry and irritable, a man so fragile and insecure that he rages at anyone who does not reflect back the version of himself he wants to see. This is why his wife and daughters look, in the photographs, a little hollowed out inside. I can see everything he is doing to them. Everything he has already done.<br> <br>You probably want him dead, strangers tell me.<br> <br>&#x201c;If we know in what way society is unbalanced, we must do what we can to add weight to the lighter scale,&#x201d; Simone Weil once wrote. In the years since I left that man, I have fallen in love many times, made a father out of a man I met on the Internet. I have created life, written whole worlds, outlined entire moral geographies for two barely domesticated children, and have learned to welcome the strangers who arrive at the doorstep of my soul. I&#x2019;ve called myself a writer now more than half of my life, and during all this time, I have learned that sometimes the hardest and most important work I&#x2019;ve done has meant turning a story I couldn&#x2019;t tell into one that I can&#x2014;and that this practice on its own is one not only of discovery but of healing.<br> <br>Is justice a story about healing? Justice is blind, we are told; it is served, maybe like a severed head on a plate. It is a destination, the path to which is long and sometimes crooked and bent. The Roman emperor Nero called it justice when he threw Christians to the beasts in the Colosseum. For some, justice means sticking to the laws, or enforcing them. For others, it means helping friends and harming enemies. Aristotle observed that justice, like language, is a &#x201c;special characteristic&#x201d; of humans. Plato suggested that justice is &#x201c;an inward g...</p><h2>Encountering God in the Abyss: Titus Brandsma&#39;s Spiritual Journey (The Fiery Arrow Collection)</h2><p>Born on a Frisian farm, Titus Brandsma (1881-1942) entered the novitiate of the Carmelites in Boxmeer.

Becoming a scholar of philosophy and mysticism, Titus Brandsma was concentrated on the depths of human existence, but his contemplation gave him a broad view of reality and made him discover ever new horizons. Although a university professor, he was a productive journalist, engaged in questions of culture and education. Prophet of peace and justice, Brandsma defended from the beginning the Jews against Nazi ideology. During the German occupation of Holland he took a strong stand in favor of the freedom of the press.

On the most basic topics--marriage, children, friendship, work, pleasure--his words have a power and lucidity that in another era would surely have provoked the description "divinely inspired."

Yet as historian David B. Woolner reveals, the last hundred might very well surpass them in drama and consequence. <br> Drawing on new evidence, Woolner shows how FDR called on every ounce of his diminishing energy to pursue what mattered most to him: the establishment of the United Nations, the reinvigoration of the New Deal, and the possibility of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. We see a president shorn of the usual distractions of office, a man whose sense of personal responsibility for the American people bore heavily upon him. As Woolner argues, even in declining health FDR displayed remarkable political talent and foresight as he focused his energies on shaping the peace to come. <br></p><p><b>David B. Woolner </b>is a senior fellow and resident historian at the Roosevelt Institute and a professor of history at Marist College. He lives in Rhinebeck, New York."Excellent...remarkably well-researched...a valuable contribution to our knowledge of Roosevelt."&#x2015;<b><i><strong><em>Washington Post</em></strong></i></b><br><br>"A balanced, readable book based on thorough archival sources that will have considerable appeal to historians and political scientists, as well as general readers interested in the presidency."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Library Journal</i></b></i></b><br><br><b>"</b>An elucidating, poignant study of an elusive leader<b>." </b>&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b></i></b><br><br>"They say the fruit tree produces its greatest harvest in its last season. Perhaps the last few months of FDR's administration, so overshadowed by the first few months, may be as important. Woolner deftly brings those last moments in power beautifully alive and leaves us with a lasting sense of the man as well as his accomplishments."&#x2015;<b>Ken Burns</b><br><br>"<i>The Last 100 Days</i> is an imaginative, deeply researched page-turner that is a pleasure to read. At a time when many Americans find the White House desolating, David Woolner invites the reader to enjoy some time with a president who, even in his final year, radiated good cheer and hope for our country's future."&#x2015;<b>William E. Leuchtenburg</b>, <b><i><b>William Rand Kenan, Jr. Professor Emeritus at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and author of <i>Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal, 1932-1940</i></b></i></b><br><br>"In this magisterial account, David Woolner makes a compelling case that FDR's last hundred days deserve to be ranked in importance with the first. Drawing on unequalled knowledge of both Roosevelt and the sources, Woolner refutes the notion of a feeble dying president who had lost his grip and was unwilling to confront difficult issues. He shows that an exhausted FDR conserved his limited energies single-mindedly to concentrate in the two most important issues facing the President--winning the war over the Axis powers and securing post-war international cooperation. A wonderfully lucid and convincing study."&#x2015;<b>Tony Badger</b>, <b><i><b>professor of American history at Northumbria University and author of <i>FDR: The First Hundred Days</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Everyone knows about FDR's First Hundred Days but until now there has been little notice of his last.

His portrait of FDR's last hundred days is a powerful reminder of courageous leadership and provides hope that we can return to presidential effectiveness in the not too distant future."&#x2015;<b>Robert Dallek</b>, <b><i><b>presidential historian and author of <i>An Unfinished Life: John F.

In <i>The Last 100 Days</i>, Woolner uses his unrivalled knowledge of the archives to bring alive with vivid new detail FDR's grand finale and to show how the dying president tried to bring peace to the world--even though his private life remained in turmoil.

While Mulberry clings to her cultural and ethical roots, Peach renounces her past to embrace the American way of life with a vengeance.<br><br>Brilliantly innovative in style, <i>Mulberry and Peach</i> offers a rare women's perspective on the upheavals of modern China, and presents an unforgettable portrait of the pain of cultural dislocation and the anguish of psychological disintegration.</p><p>Hualing Nieh co-founded the International Writing Program at the University of Iowa.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Chinese</p><h2>College Prep 101, Second Edition</h2><p>College Prep 101 is a handbook for those involved in the process of selecting, applying to and enrolling in college. It&#39;s an excellent resource for students, parents, and educators alike, and no high school library or counseling office should be without a copy. Readers are walked through each step of the college application and selection process, from planning for college to college visits, and choosing a college to college entrance exams. Checklists are provided for each year of high school, listing the important steps to take each year, and there&#39;s even a list of items to pack and take to college when the time comes. Finances feature prominently within the pages, as the chapter entitled College and Money provides direction through both applying for scholarships and the financial aid process. In addition, decision making and prioritizing are discussed as bases for spending decisions while the student is actually in college. Millis&#39; second title, &#34;How to Go to College Cheaper&#34; goes into great detail on this topic. The transition from high school to college is also discussed, including extensive coverage of study skills and time management. Students are encouraged to find their own system or style of studying through answering six simple questions and using whichever of the suggested strategies are most effective for them. Organization, prioritization, and decision making are discussed as the basis for effective time management - a skill many college students struggle with. Parents too will find information written specifically for them inside, with their own list of &#39;must-do&#39; items, a chapter detailing how they can help their student through this process (and deal with it themselves), and specific suggestions hi-lighted throughout the book. The book&#39;s thirteen chapters cover all the bases without boring the reader with unnecessary text. It is written in a straight-forward, conversational style that is easy to read, and the numerous lists provide excellent resources you&#39;ll refer to again and again.</p><p>I hope you enjoy and get a lot out of this book.&nbsp; It's been a labor of love for me&nbsp;since 1996, when the first iteration was actually a web site hosted by my alma mater, Oklahoma State University.&nbsp; In 2007, we published the first edition, and received a wonderful response from high schools, colleges, families and students alike.&nbsp; <br><br>This second edition was created for three main reasons:&nbsp; 1. because of changes to the ACT and SAT, as well as the electronic environment college selection now&nbsp;takes place in, 2. because my perspective has changed in the last 15+&nbsp;years from writing mostly&nbsp;to students, to now writing&nbsp;to students <b>and</b> parents (probably because I am now a parent&nbsp;myself), and 3. because I've sold all the books I had!<br><br>Best of luck on your college selection process!<br><br>LanceLance Millis has over twenty years of experience in higher education, including 7 in student recruitment and over 15 in academic advisement and student services administration at a large, public university in Oklahoma.

It takes a unique form: a dialogue between two imaginary figures, a master and his disciple, in which the disciple tenaciously pursues the master's pity utterances with follow-up questions that propel the dialogue toward ever more profound insights. And these questions prove to be the reader's very own. Soko Morinaga brings alive this compact and brilliant text with his own vivid commentary.<br><br>This volume also includes a generous selection from Morinaga's acclaimed autobiography, <i>Novice to Master: An Ongoing Lesson in the Extent of my Own Stupidity</i>.</p><p>Soko Morinaga, was head of Hanazono University and abbot of Daishu-in in Kyoto, one of the twenty-four sub-temples of Daitoku-ji. After finding himself adrift following World War Two, he took up Zen training at Daishuin under Goto Zuigan, formerly abbot of Myoshin-ji and at that time abbot of Daitoku-ji. Morinaga later became the Dharma successor to Oda Sesso Roshi, becoming head monk of Daitoku-ji. He taught regularly at Rinzai temples in California and in England during the latter part of his life. He is author of <i>Pointers to Insight: Life of a Zen Monk</i>, <i>The Ceasing of Notions: Zen Text from the Tun-Huang Caves</i>, and <i>Novice to Master: An Ongoing Lesson in the Extent of My Own Stupidity</i>. Morinaga Roshi passed away in 1995.<br><br>Martin Collcutt is a professor of East Asian studies and history at Princeton University, where he teaches Japanese intellectual and cultural history. He also has a particular interest in the introduction and development of the monastic practice in Japanese Rinzai Zen. In the 1960s he studied and practiced Zen in Japan and met Morinaga Roshi at Daishuin in Kyoto. Subsequently he served as Roshi's interpreter on some of his visits to the United States and England. His academic background in Japanese Zen and his personal and longstanding involvement with Morinaga Roshi and his teaching makes Professor Collcutt's informative introduction a valuable contribution to the understanding of this classic text.<i>*from the foreword </i><br><br><i>The Ceasing of Notions</i> is the title given to the translation of the Chinese texts from Dunhuang, which are called the <i>Jue-guan lun</i> in Chinese and <i>Zekkanron</i> in Japanese. The vast caves near Dunhuang, an oasis on the ancient Silk Road in the Gansu province of western China, also known as the Mogao Caves and the Caves of the Thousand Buddhas, comprised a network of 492 ancient temples. From the fourth until the fourteenth century, Buddhist monks at Dunhuang who used the remote caves as places for prayer and meditation in their search for enlightenment collected scriptures, sacred paintings, and statues from western Asia and Tibet. Pilgrims passing through the area painted murals covering some four hundred and fifty thousand square feet inside the caves. Construction of the Buddhist cave shrines began around 366 CE as places to store scriptures and works of art. The caves thus came to serve as repositories for thousands of sacred texts and contain some of the finest examples of early Buddhist art spanning a period of a thousand years.<br>Sometime after the eleventh century, some of the caves were walled off and used as storehouses for used and damaged manuscripts and religious objects. They remained virtually unknown until the early twentieth century. Then, in the early 1900s, a Chinese Daoist named Wang Yuanlu, who was acting as the guardian of some of these cave temples, discovered a walled-up area beside a corridor leading to a main cave. Behind the wall was a small cave stuffed with an enormous hoard of manuscripts and paintings on hemp, silk, or paper dating from 406 to 1002 CE. These included ancient Buddhist texts in Chinese and other Asian languages. Among them were several manuscript copies of the text offered here as <i>The Ceasing of Notions</i>.<br>Around 1907, Wang Yuanlu sold many of the ancient scrolls to Western travelers exploring the Silk Road, including Sir Aurel Stein and Paul Pelliot, who eagerly acquired these rare Buddhist texts and carried them back to Europe. The Japanese Buddhist scholars D.T. Suzuki and Kuno Horyu, among others, seem to have rediscovered copies of the text in Pelliot&#x2019;s collection in the early 1930s.<br>Discussing, as it does, the path to enlightenment, this text has long had an important place in Chinese and Japanese Zen thought and practice.<br>[ ]<br><br>Let us now look more closely at the text of, and Morinaga Roshi&#x2019;s commentary on, <i>The Ceasing of Notions</i>. Here, using one or two examples, I will try to point out some of the ways in which Morinaga makes this elusive ancient text accessible to readers who, like Emmon, have many questions to ask about their own search for the Way of the Buddha, and their possible attainment of enlightenment.<br><i>The Ceasing of Notions</i> is clearly intended as a practical straightforward translation of, and guide to, an early Zen text that crystallizes many of the essentials of Zen thought, and one that is as relevant now as it was in Tang dynasty China. The work itself is in the form of a dialogue or series of questions and answers between two imaginary figures: master Nyuri and his disciple Emmon.<br>Although the original Chinese text is undivided, the Japanese editors have divided it into fifteen sections. This division is followed in this English translation of <i>The Ceasing of Notions</i>. Each section clusters questions and answers around a principal topic. Section I, for instance, deals with the central question of finding the Great Way of the Buddha and pacifying the heart (or, as it was translated by McRae, the mind the Chinese character <i>xin</i> is the heart, moral nature, the mind, the affections, and the intention, but it is translated here as <i>heart</i> throughout):<br><br>1a The Great Way is without limit, fathomless and subtle, beyond comprehension, beyond words.<br>Master Nyuri (whose name means Entrance into the Principle&#x201d;) and his disciple Emmon ( Gate of Affinities&#x201d;) discuss the truth.<br>The enlightened Zen master Nyuri is guiding his disciple Emmon in his search for self-understanding. Their conversation opens with Nyuri&#x2019;s presentation of the Great Way (of the truth of the universe) as without limit, fathomless and subtle, beyond comprehension, beyond words.&#x201d;<br>In his comment Roshi discusses <i>fathomless and subtle</i> by raising the issue of causation in Buddhism, expressed in the Japanese term <i>innen</i>, which he explains in terms of its two constituent characters: <i>in</i>, inner cause,&#x201d; and <i>en</i>, the factors contributing to that cause. And then, to clarify this rather abstruse distinction, he introduces the analogy of a bell in which the ability to make sound is its <i>in</i> and the factors contributing to that sound the clapper, the metal, the size of the bell, etc. are the <i>en</i>. And when they meet the sound of the bell is manifest.<br>Just as master Nyuri uses skillful means&#x201d; to shake Emmon out of his confusion and into self-awakening, so the Roshi too uses skillful means to clarify the text, and its true meaning, for his students and the reader. He uses traditional Japanese analogies like the bell and its ability to make sound, examples from daily life, and natural phenomena; he explains in detail Buddhist terminology and formulae that are only briefly referred to in the text, such as emptiness, thusness, karma, and the four erroneous views of phenomena. In the course of his commentary he makes us familiar with passages and ideas from other sutras and introduces us to many of the sayings and doings of Zen masters over the ages. Roshi&#x2019;s comments on Master Nyuri&#x2019;s questions and Emmon&#x2019;s responses help readers to find their own awakening and true nature in the ceasing of notions. In conclusion Roshi comments:<br><br>When even the last traces are gone, that is when all the dirt of delusions has been washed off, together with the soap of the teaching, training, enlightenment, and nothing at all remains no smell of Zen, no ideology, no philosophy, no Buddha then the true nature functions freely and without any obstacles.<br></p><h2>El Norte: The Cuisine of Northern Mexico (Red Crane Cookbook Series)</h2><p>The cooking of northern Mexico got its spark from the ranching culture, in which food was prepared with indigenous ingredients and cooked over a wood fire.

Cyril of Jerusalem wrote about &#34;holy things.&#34; He thereby reflected the communion invitation used in his fourth-century liturgy to call people to &#34;taste and see that the Lord is good&#34; (Mystagogical Catecheses). The present times call for strong and healthy symbols that hold people into hope. The Christian communities need a reintroduction into the ways in which liturgical symbols respond to human need. Indeed, Lathrop argues, Christian communities continually need to reconsider the meaning of their liturgies and reform those liturgies toward authentic clarity. In its three parts, this book (1) proposes that an ecumenical pattern or ordo of worship can be discerned which is also a pattern of meaning, (2) discusses the ways in which meaning occurs in the meeting for worship itself, and (3) draws practical conclusions about the organization of that meeting and its importance to current human need. Throughout, Lathrop undertakes to do theology, that is, to say what the liturgy actually says about God.</p><p>Lathrop is Charles A.

A deeply researched analysis of a bloody eighteenth-century conflict and its tangled aftermath, <i>The Four Deaths of Acorn Whistler</i> unearths competing accounts of the events surrounding the death of this Creek Indian. Told from the perspectives of a colonial governor, a Creek Nation military leader, local Native Americans, and British colonists, each story speaks to issues that transcend the condemned man&#x2019;s fate: the collision of European and Native American cultures, the struggle of Indians to preserve traditional ways of life, and tensions within the British Empire as the American Revolution approached.</p><p>At the hand of his own nephew, Acorn Whistler was executed in the summer of 1752 for the crime of murdering five Cherokee men. War had just broken out between the Creeks and the Cherokees to the north. To the east, colonists in South Carolina and Georgia watched the growing conflict with alarm, while British imperial officials kept an eye on both the Indians&#x2019; war and the volatile politics of the colonists themselves. They all interpreted the single calamitous event of Acorn Whistler&#x2019;s death through their own uncertainty about the future. Joshua Piker uses their diverging accounts to uncover the larger truth of an early America rife with violence and insecurity but also transformative possibility.</p></p><p>Joshua Piker is Associate Professor of History and Second Century Associates Presidential Professor at the University of Oklahoma.Pocahontas. Sacajawea. Sitting Bull. Crazy Horse. Acorn Whistler? This Creek Indian's life will never put him in the pantheon of renowned Native Americans. But it is his death, not his life, that matters--or, rather, it is the stories that colonists and Creeks made up about his demise. Unpacking and untangling those tales, <b>Joshua Piker</b>'s fine book reveals nothing less than 'the way life in colonial America worked.' (James H. Merrell, author of <i>The Indians' New World</i>)<br><br><b>Piker</b> is an excellent storyteller, and <i>The Four Deaths of Acorn Whistler</i> is an intriguing tale--told in four different ways--that showcases his dazzling historical detective work. He skillfully uses Creek Indian history as a window into early America. (Jenny Hale Pulsipher, author of <i>Subjects unto the Same King: Indians, English, and the Contest for Authority in Colonial New England</i>)<br><br>As American historians contemplate how best to reintegrate narrative into our work, <b>Piker</b> provides us with a model. Not only is <i>The Four Deaths of Acorn Whistler</i> beautifully written, it also considers the nature and impact of storytelling, suggesting that in the end we are who we are because of the tales we tell to ourselves and to others. (Ari Kelman, author of <i>A Misplaced Massacre: Struggling over the Memory of Sand Creek</i>)<br><br><b>Josh Piker</b> follows his superb first book, <i>Okfuskee</i>, with a sharply observed and deeply researched analysis of a bloody conflict and its tangled--and ultimately murderous--aftermath. His examination of the multiple narratives of Whistler's death forces us to consider the nature of documentary evidence and story-telling in early North America. (Peter C.

His illustrations have appeared in The New Yorker as well as in books for children. He lives in England.Gr 3-5-Freedman tackles the Boston Tea Party with his characteristic energy and rigor and provides a gripping account of the nation-defining episode. He starts with a lucid, two-page introduction offering historical context-not stopping to get bogged down in the details of the Stamp Tax and its ilk-before he vaults into his story with a promising opening that mixes fact and suspense. From that page forward, he weaves together meticulously sourced quotations and information with engaging personal details to effectively enliven the tense, silent act of rebellion. Along with the usual heroes of the Revolution-Samuel Adams, Paul Revere, etc.-Freedman presents the actions of young men such as a rope-maker's apprentice who snuck out a window to join the mob and the mason-in-training who detoured to the protest on his way to a date. These charming and enlightening particulars, including many direct quotes, lend immediacy and emotional weight to the account, told in an effective but surprisingly casual tone. Freedman's absorbing and informative story is somewhat underserved by Malone's illustrations. A rich, earthy palette and period details, even with an occasional spark of humor, can't quite overcome the static feeling of the pictures, which resemble watercolor renditions of an American history diorama with their stiff-armed figures and blank faces. Fortunately, Freedman's text proves lively enough for both. Back matter includes a note on the importance of tea in colonial American life.-Robbin E.

Brien</i> made Iowa only the third state in the nation to permit same-sex couples to wed&#x2014;moderate, midwestern Iowa, years before such left-leaning coastal states as California and New York. And unlike the earlier decisions in Massachusetts and Connecticut, <i>Varnum v. Brien</i> was unanimous and unequivocal. It catalyzed the unprecedented and rapid shift in law and public opinion that continues today.<br> <br> <i>Equal Before the Law</i> tells the stories behind this critical battle in the fight for marriage equality and traces the decision&#x2019;s impact. The struggle began in 1998 with the easy passage of Iowa&#x2019;s Defense of Marriage Act and took a turn, surprising to many, in 2005, when six ordinary Iowa couples signed on to Lambda Legal&#x2019;s suit against the law. Their triumph in 2009 sparked a conservative backlash against the supreme court justices, three of whom faced tough retention elections that fall.<br> Longtime, award-winning reporters Tom Witosky and Marc Hansen talked with and researched dozens of key figures, including opponent Bob Vander Plaats, proponents Janelle Rettig and Sharon Malheiro, attorneys Roger Kuhle, Dennis Johnson, and Camilla Taylor, and politicians Matt McCoy, Mary Lundby, and Tom Vilsack, who had to weigh their careers against their convictions. Justice Mark Cady, who wrote the decision, explains why the court had to rule in favor of the plaintiffs. At the center of the story are the six couples who sacrificed their privacy to demand public respect for their families.<br> <br> Through these voices, Witosky and Hansen show that no one should have been surprised by the 2009 decision. Iowans have a long history of leadership on civil rights. Just a year after Iowa became a state, its citizens adopted as their motto the phrase, &#x201c;Our liberties we prize and our rights we will maintain.&#x201d; And they still do today.<br></p></p><p>For thirty-three years, <b>Tom Witosky</b> covered Iowa politics, law, business, and sports for the <i>Des Moines Register</i>, reporting many major stories and gaining a reputation for innovative investigative journalism.

"The advice you gave that woman in Atlanta came straight from the pits of hell," someone, probably a man, had written. "Leave her husband? Marriage is for better or worse, but you want to overturn God's laws and institute your own."<br><br> I felt my cheeks burn as I leaned back in my chair. Though I had grown accustomed to vitriolic mail of all types, criticism never failed to sting. Beneath the bluster and bravado I'd adopted as part of my radio persona, I constantly worried that I would hurt someone in a reckless moment of glib patter.<br><br> "Gary"&#x2014;I glanced over my shoulder&#x2014;"do you remember a woman calling from Atlanta?"<br><br> "Yeah." He snapped his gum. "Yesterday. You told her to pack up and run like mad."<br><br> "That was the abuse case, right? The woman with the broken jaw?"<br><br> Gary nodded. "The husband had put her in ICU the month before. How could you forget that one?"<br><br> "I didn't forget." I fingered the edge of the paper as I studied the e-mail. "I just wanted to be sure I remembered it correctly."<br><br> No, no cause for guilt on this one. God did want us to weather good and bad in our marriages, but I have never believed he intended women to be used as punching bags. The nameless coward who had sent this note could bluster all he wanted; my counsel in that situation had been sound.<br><br> I slid the paper to the desk and glanced at the clock. Nine fifty-eight, so I still had two minutes until the top of the hour, followed by eight minutes of news and commercials. Plenty of time for a break.<br><br> I flipped through the remaining e-mails. "Anything interesting in here?"<br><br> Gary shrugged. "The usual. People calling you intolerant and a hardhearted witch. Oh, and one calling you a child-abuser."<br><br> I snorted a laugh. "Because I told that one woman to swat her kid on the rear?"<br><br> "That's the one. The lady says she's going to report you to Social Services."<br><br> "She'll have to catch me swatting my kids first." I stood and stretched, then pressed my hands to the small of my back and grinned at my producer. "My kids never need swatting. They're angels."<br><br> Gary made a face at that, but he didn't argue. Truth was, my kids were good kids, and he knew it. At eighteen, Brittany Jane's only major flaw was her stubborn refusal to keep food out of the cluttered cave she called a bedroom, and Scott Daniel, age five, was a bundle of pure delight.<br><br> Taking advantage of the break, I left the studio as Gary followed. We visited the coffeemaker in the snack area, filled our mugs with liquid caffeine, then stood and drank, enjoying the quiet break while keeping a careful eye on the clock.<br><br> Our building, owned by Open Air Communications, housed several radio stations&#x2014;among them WUBN, the Gulf Coast's hard-rock headquarters; WSHE, soft rock from the sixties and seventies; WNAR, home of the county's best jazz; and WCTY, the voice of new country. At any given hour you could walk down the halls and peer into studio windows of a half-dozen broadcasters, all saying something different on the invisible airways that carried our words, healthy and perverse, across the nation.<br><br> Sometimes the thought left me feeling a little dizzy.<br><br> Gary took a final sip from his mug, then pointed to the clock. "Time."<br><br> I nodded, then followed him down the hall. A door swung open as we passed WCTY, allowing a stream of country music to flow through the hall. I shook my head as the lyrics followed us: I'm so miserable without you, it's like having you here.<br><br> As Chad Potter, our sound engineer, punched up the theme music for my show, I slipped back into the air studio and took my place behind the desk.<br><br> On the phone, a half-dozen blinking buttons flashed at me; each of them representing someone who had called and remained on hold through the commercials, the news, and the theme music. I would never cease to marvel at the patience of some callers. Most of them would hang on even through the monologue I delivered at the beginning of every segment.<br><br> As the theme music faded, I settled the headphones on my head&#x2014;the better to hear my producer and sound engineer from the control room&#x2014;and leaned forward on the desk.<br> <br> "Welcome back, friends and neighbors, to another hour of the Dr. Sheldon Show. You know, some people look for flowers and robins as a herald of spring; I look for the Nordstrom catalog. I know I'll be on the cutting edge of fashion just by perusing its contents, and this year I was not disappointed. Now I know some of you may think it's not possible to be fashionable by osmosis, but I beg to differ. I mean, what is fashion, but clothing that's in one year and out the next? Right now my closet is stuffed with things from when I first got married, so something tells me I'm about to ride the crest of high fashion once again."<br><br> I paused to pick up my notepad, then ruffled the pages in front of the mike. "As I flipped through the catalog this year, though, one group of products confused me. I don't know if you've seen these things in the stores yet, but what is the deal with toe toppers and foot tubes? I mean, have you seen those things? I suppose they're for wearing with slides and sandals, but they kind of defeat the purpose. The toe toppers&#x2014;I know, it's hard to imagine anything with that silly a name being practical&#x2014;are half a sock. They start at the toe like an ordinary sock, and end at the arch of your foot. Now I ask you, what is that about? Do you wear them with high-heeled, elegant sandals? And have this terrycloth thing hanging out?"<br><br> Silently I counted out a beat, then laughed. "And foot tubes-have you seen those? They're like the calf warmers we all bought when that Jennifer Beals movie came out . . . you know, the woman welder who wanted to&#x2014;Flashdance, that was it. Anyway, these foot tubes are like calf warmers, but they cover only the middle part of your foot. Your tootsies and your heels are still left out in the cold to freeze or sweat, depending on whether you're wearing them in Montana or Florida."<br><br> Looking through the rectangular window that opened into the control room, I saw Gary holding a hand over his face. Because he knew women comprised the majority of my audience, he tolerated my female-oriented monologues, but just barely.<br><br> "Toe toppers and foot tubes." I breathed a heavy sigh into the mike. "Somebody please tell me this fad will pass."<br><br> I glanced up at the list of names on the computer monitor, then pressed the first button on the beige plastic phone. "Carla! Welcome to the show."<br><br> "Dr. Diana! Goodness, I can't believe I'm really talking to you."<br><br> I cast Gary a didn't-you-tell-her-to-get-to-the-point? look, then shoehorned a smile into my voice. "Have you seen those toe toppers in the stores yet?"<br><br> "No&#x2014;and I agree, they sound silly."<br><br> "I think so. But how can I help you today?"<br><br> "It's my mother&#x2014;I mean mother-in-law. She's mousy&#x2014;I mean mouthy&#x2014;good grief, I'm nervous!"<br><br> "Calm down, Carla. We haven't lost a caller yet." I glanced up at the computer screen, where next to Carla's name Gary had typed MIL insults her constantly. Advice?<br><br> Though the woman might be nervous simply because she was on the radio, I knew her anxiety might also have arisen from the fact that her mother-in-law could be listening . . . so I'd have bet my bottom dollar that Carla wasn't her real name.<br><br> My caller exhaled into the phone, eliciting an agonized expression from Chad at the soundboard.<br><br> "Okay. It's like this&#x2014;I love my husband, I really do, but his mother is driving me crazy. Everything I do, she has to criticize&#x2014;my clothes, my cooking, the way I keep house. I have a job, you see, so what does it matter if the shelves get a little dusty? Her son doesn't read books anyway, so what does she care? And lately Joe and I have been talking about having a baby&#x2014;"<br><br> "Joe is your husband?"<br><br> "Yes. Sorry, I should have said that."<br><br> "And how long have you been married?"<br><br> "Six months." She exhaled another deep breath, obviously grateful that I had taken control of the conversation.<br><br> Flashing a grin at Chad, I silently tapped the windscreen on my microphone with two fingers, reminding him that I knew better than to huff and puff into his expensive equipment.<br><br> "I'm glad you called, Carla, and I'm glad you didn't wait to address this issue. Because if you allow this situation to continue, you will be dealing with the problem for as long as your marriage lasts&#x2014;which, in my opinion, won't be long past your fifth anniversary. Men who allow their mothers to criticize their wives tend to lose their wives' respect, and respect is one of the most important ingredients in marriage."<br><br> I paused a moment to let my words take hold. "Let me ask you this, Carla&#x2014;do you know much about your mother-in-law's history?"<br><br> "Um . . . not really. Should I?"<br><br> "It might be helpful. We'll talk about your husband in a moment, but first let me remind you of one of my favorite profound sayings. Are you ready?"<br><br> "Yeah, sure."<br><br> "Here it is: Hurt people . . . hurt people."<br><br> In the control room, Chad played the blast of a trumpet, the usual sound effect for one of what he called Dr. Diana's pronouncements.<br><br> Grinning at him, I pulled the mike closer. "If your mother-in-law is honestly vindictive toward you, she may be acting out of pain. Somewhere, someone has hurt her badly, and she has not yet learned how to deal with that hurt. You may be the source of her pain, through some direct or indirect action, or her issues may spring from something completely unrelated to you."<br><br> "So what do I do about it?"<br><br> "You do this&#x2014;first, you ask your mother-in-law if you've done something to offend her. Say you've noticed that she seems out of sorts around you, and ask if you can do something to make things right. If she names something&#x2014;say, for example, you inadvertently ran over her petunias&#x2014;then apologize and offer to replant her flowers. If, on the other hand, she denies her attitude or says you've done nothing to hurt her feelings, then your conscience should be clear.<br><br> "Second, you talk to your husband and tell him you love him dearly, you admire him to death, but you married him, not his mother. So the next time his mother criticizes you, if he doesn't politely excuse himself and lead you out of Mama's presence, he'll be disappointing you tremendously. Leave and cleave, Carla&#x2014;that's what marriage is about. Leaving the parental nest and cleaving to your spouse. If your husband doesn't want to be firm in the face of his mother's wailing&#x2014;and believe me, she will wail the first few times he stands up to her&#x2014;then you'll just have to resign yourself to the fact that you married a spineless mama's boy."<br><br> In the control room, Chad clicked a key and sent the wail of a frustrated baby over the airwaves.<br><br> I grinned at him while Carla sputtered protestations. "But I thought men who took care of their mothers were, like, programmed to take care of their wives! My mother always said I should notice how a boy treats his mom, and he was always so deferential to her&#x2014;"<br><br> "There's a vast difference between treating a woman with respect and kowtowing to her every demand." I lowered my voice and leaned closer to the microphone. "I know it's not easy, Carla, but your husband might need a lot of encouragement before he'll be able to stand up to his mom. I wish you'd noticed his disposition toward docility while you were dating."<br><br> "I did notice his&#x2014;whatever you said. But I was sure he'd change once we were married."<br><br> "Men don't change, sweetie, apart from acts of God. They fossilize."<br><br> I cocked my index finger toward Chad, who clicked the next button and took us into commercial. After pulling the headphones from my ears, I picked up the telephone. The promo for Nutriment Weight Loss Solutions dropped to a muted mumble when Chad saw I held the receiver.<br><br> "Carla," I spoke into the phone, "we're off the air now. Listen, dear, I'm not saying you should give up on your husband. I'm saying you and Joe need to open the lines of communication. Tell him you love him, make him feel like your protector. That's probably all he needs to rise to the task. If you make him feel like he can take on the world, taking on his mama will be a lot easier."<br><br> "I'll try." Carla sniffled into the phone, a sound I'd heard a thousand times, but still it got to me. "Thanks, Dr. Diana."<br><br> "You're welcome, sweetie. God bless."<br><br> I disconnected the call, then glanced at the computer monitor where a queue of bright green rectangles listed all holding callers. Gary moved interesting people straight to the top of the list; he relegated weirdos or off-topic calls to the bottom.<br><br> Rarely did we resort to bottom-feeding.<br><br> Four callers were now waiting&#x2014;according to Gary's notes, the woman at the top of the queue was dealing with a blended family, the man after her was calling about a troubled sixteen-year-old, and the name beneath his belonged to ten-year-old Tiffany, who wanted to ask a question for her school report. The last caller, Lela, was wondering about the wisdom of leaving her money to a spoiled grandchild.<br><br> Lifting a brow, I peered through the rectangular window before Gary's desk. Lela was bound to strike a nerve with my local audience, so she must have sounded like a real dud to earn last place in the lineup. Though my show was syndicated and broadcast on sixty-two stations nationwide&#x2014;with new stations signing on every week&#x2014;the folks in Tampa cared deeply about elder issues. Probably 75 percent of the people in my local listening audience were retired snowbirds, particularly in this month of March.<br><br> Through the wide windows separating me from the technical brains of my program I could see Chad, my engineer, hunched over his board, his magic fingers adjusting knobs and sliders whose functions remained a mystery to me even after five years in radio. Gary, my producer and call screener, hunched over the phone, his brow crinkled in concentration as he greeted another caller. His hands moved to the keyboard, and in a moment he'd click enter and send the information to me.<br><br> As the commercial played out, I settled the headset back on my head and glanced at the computer screen. I didn't often buck Gary's suggested order, but I wasn't in the mood to discuss blended families. The ten-year-old might be more fun.<br><br> I clicked the button for line three as the intro music faded away. "Tiffany, honey, are you there? This is Dr. Diana."<br><br> A heavy breath whooshed into the phone, then, "Hello?"<br><br> "Hello, Tiffany. Did you have a question to ask me?"<br><br> More heavy breathing, followed by a decidedly childish giggle.

While the First Peoples of Canada and other parts of the world have developed deep cultural understandings of plants and their environments, this knowledge is often underrecognized in debates about land rights and title, reconciliation, treaty negotiations, and traditional territories. Plants, People, and Places argues that the time is long past due to recognize and accommodate Indigenous Peoples&#39; relationships with plants and their ecosystems. Essays in this volume, by leading voices in philosophy, Indigenous law, and environmental sustainability, consider the critical importance of botanical and ecological knowledge to land rights and related legal and government policy, planning, and decision making in Canada, the United States, Sweden, and New Zealand. Analyzing specific cases in which Indigenous Peoples&#39; inherent rights to the environment have been denied or restricted, this collection promotes future prosperity through more effective and just recognition of the historical use of and care for plants in Indigenous cultures. A timely book featuring Indigenous perspectives on reconciliation, environmental sustainability, and pathways toward ethnoecological restoration, Plants, People, and Places reveals how much there is to learn from the history of human relationships with nature.</p><p>Nancy J.

Stories are strange beasts, full of unexpected turns, and like all art forms they should not be safe. So I approached this book with a deal of nervousness. I was pleasantly surprised. The book contains 21 chapters from different authors, exploring different ways in which stories can be used to useful ends for the environment. The chapters vary widely &#x2013; from Martin Shaw&#x2019;s offering of more spiritual rites of passage and wilderness, through David Metcalfe&#x2019;s exploration of how a story circle can make a difference, to Chris Holland&#x2019;s glorious blobster-building workshops, there is a great deal to learn here from the hands-on experience of the writers.

Her book, <i>The Thinking Body</i>, described new ways to use all the senses as well as inner feeling and imagination to retrain the body to move with ease and balance. The system became an invaluable tool for generations of dancers, actors, and performance artists, thanks largely to one of its most important teachers, Andr� Bernard (1924-2003). This book presents an introduction to the practice as well as a lengthy interview with Bernard and two meticulously detailed workshop protocols illustrated with 52 photographs and line drawings.</p><p>Andr� Bernard was raised in Columbia, South Carolina. He graduated at age nineteen from the University of South Carolina with a chemistry and math major and a theater minor. His professional acting career included over a hundred performances both On and Off Broadway and appearances on television. Bernard was a student of Barbara Clark, who further developed ideokinesis after she studied with the founder, Mabel Elsworth Todd. From 1966 until 2001, Bernard taught ideokinesis at the New York University and elsewhere. He died in May 2003 in New York City.Wolfgang Steinmuller studied medicine in Freiburg/Brsg, Germany, and trained in the Feldenkrais method with Mia Segal from 1986 to 1989. His important teachers in the field of movement have included Andre Bernard and Amos Hetz of Israel. He works as a physician in private practice. He is the anatomy teacher and medical director of the Soma-Institut, which offers continuing education for bodyworkers.Ursula Stricker has been dancing and drawing ever since she could. She lives and works as visual and movement artist and teacher for placement and creative dance in Oberdiessbach and Bern, Switzerland."[Andr� Bernard] taught with uncommon sensitivity and unparalleled knowledge of the kinesthetic realm.

Ciudad Ju�rez, Chihuahua, adjacent to El Paso, Texas, has become the most violent city in the Mexican drug war. Much of the cocaine, marijuana, and methamphetamine consumed in the United States is imported across the Mexican border, making El Paso/Ju�rez one of the major drug-trafficking venues in the world.</p><p>In this anthropological study of drug trafficking and anti-drug law enforcement efforts on the U.S.-Mexico border, Howard Campbell uses an ethnographic perspective to chronicle the recent Mexican drug war, focusing especially on people and events in the El Paso/Ju�rez area. It is the first social science study of the violent drug war that is tearing Mexico apart.</p><p>Based on deep access to the drug-smuggling world, this study presents the drug war through the eyes and lives of direct participants. Half of the book consists of oral histories from drug traffickers, and the other half from law enforcement officials. There is much journalistic coverage of the drug war, but very seldom are the lived experiences of traffickers and "narcs" presented in such vivid detail. In addition to providing an up-close, personal view of the drug-trafficking world, Campbell explains and analyzes the functioning of drug cartels, the corruption that facilitates drug trafficking, the strategies of smugglers and anti-narcotics officials, and the perilous culture of drug trafficking that Campbell refers to as the "Drug War Zone."</p></p><p>Howard Campbell is Professor of Sociology and Anthropology at the University of Texas at El Paso.

Chopra guides us from his beginnings in India, through the conventional training of a Western physician, to his discovery of the ancient traditions of India&#39;s Ayurveda and the dimension of the mind in medicine.</p><p><p><b>Deepak Chopra, M.D.,</b> Founder and CEO, The Chopra Foundation, Adjunct Professor of Executive Programs at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, Adjunct Professor at Columbia Business School, Columbia University, and Senior Scientist with The Gallup Organization. www.choprafoundation.org</p>In 1980 Chopra was a chain-smoking Boston physician schooled in Western ways, proud of his beeper, attending to heart and asthma patients. But a meeting with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, founder of the Transcendental Meditation movement, rekindled his interest in the Ayurvedic medicine he knew during his Indian boyhood. How the author gave up his prestigious hospital career, practiced TM and became a leading exponent of the Ayurvedic system in the U.S. is the thrust of this reflective if self-infatuated autobiography. The ancient Indian system of herbal and mineral cures stresses balance with nature and calling upon the patient's inner resources. As Chopra shuttles between growing up in India, medical school (where a holy man was buried alive and survived) and encounters with the ill, one longs for more detail about how Ayurvedic medicine works, and rather less about the guru whom he reveres. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Oedipus Rex (Wisconsin Studies in Classics)</h2><p>Oedipus Rex is the greatest of the Greek tragedies, a profound meditation on the human condition. The story of the mythological king, who is doomed to kill his father and marry his mother, has resonated in world culture for almost 2,500 years. But Sophocles&#39; drama as originally performed was much more than a great story-it was a superb poetic script and exciting theatrical experience. The actors spoke in pulsing rhythms with hypnotic forward momentum, making it hard for audiences to look away. Interspersed among the verbal rants and duels were energetic songs performed by the chorus. David Mulroy&#39;s brilliant verse translation of Oedipus Rex recaptures the aesthetic power of Sophocles&#39; masterpiece while also achieving a highly accurate translation in clear, contemporary English. Speeches are rendered with the same kind of regular iambic rhythm that gave the Sophoclean originals their drive. The choral parts are translated as fluid rhymed songs. Mulroy also supplies an introduction, notes, and appendixes to provide helpful context for general readers and students.</p><p>Considered by many the greatest of the classic Greek tragedies, <i>Oedipus Rex</i> is Sophocles' finest play and a work of extraordinary power and resonance. Aristotle considered it a masterpiece of dramatic construction and refers to it frequently in the <i>Poetics</i>.<br>In presenting the story of King Oedipus and the tragedy that ensues when he discovers he has inadvertently killed his father and married his mother, the play exhibits near-perfect harmony of character and action. Moreover, the masterly use of dramatic irony greatly intensifies the impact of the agonizing events and emotions experienced by Oedipus and the other characters in the play. Now these and many other facets of this towering tragedy may be studied and appreciated in Dover's attractive inexpensive edition of one of the great landmarks of Western drama.<br>A selection of the Common Core State Standards Initiative.<p>Sophocles<b></b>(ca. 497/6-407/6 BCE) was the most acclaimed dramatist of his era, winning more than twenty festival competitions in ancient Athens. He is believed to have written 123 plays, but only seven have survived in a complete form. David Mulroy is professor of classics at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. He has translated <i>The Complete Poetry of Catullus</i>, also published by the University of Wisconsin Press.</p></p><h2>Black Storm Comin&#39;</h2><p><b>WANTED: Young, skinny, wiry fellows not over eighteen.

She lives in Escondido, California. Visit her online at DianeLeeWilson.com.Grade 6-10 -In 1860, Colton Wescott, 12, is determined to keep his Sacramento-bound family alive and heading west. His distraught white father abandons the family after accidentally shooting his son; the wagon master has ordered the mixed-race family to leave the wagon train; his freed-slave mother is sick from childbirth; and his two sisters cling to Colton in hopes of survival. When they finally arrive in Chinatown, 12 miles outside Carson City, NV, a sign for Pony Express riders captivates Colton, who lies about his age, passes for white, demonstrates his horse-handling skill, and is hired for the dangerous ride over the mountains. When he is injured in a fall, he loses his job but decides to take matters into his own hands. Eschewing the superintendent's orders and Pony Express protocol, he grabs the mail, rides his own temperamental horse, and heads for Sacramento, knowing he might be carrying news of two subversive plots "to blow up some forts and steal some ammunition" and to assassinate Presidential candidate Lincoln. Heroically, Colton delivers the mail, finds his mother's runaway sister, and gives her precious legal papers proving her freedom. Colton is determined, reflective, and courageous in his vivid, vernacular descriptions of moral dilemmas, treacherous trails, and exhaustion. Based on historical facts and footnotes, this fictional account offers an appealing, energetic, and provocative look at racial issues across America, the remarkable but short-lived scheme of Pony Express service, the fortitude of its riders, and the courage of one boy who stands up for family, himself, and his beliefs.<i>-Gerry Larson, Durham School of the Arts, NC</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He cares a lot. Obviously. If he didn&#x2019;t, he wouldn&#x2019;t&#x2019;ve walked a mile from Manny&#x2019;s house at three in the morning (Manny&#x2019;s of the opinion that Melo&#x2019;s &#x201c;the worst thing that ever happened&#x201d; to Jus, so of course he refused to give his boy a ride).

He closes his eyes as Manny&#x2019;s words ring through his head: This Captain Save-�A-�Ho thing is gonna get you in trouble, dawg.<br><br> He looks Melo over. She&#x2019;s now sitting with her head leaned back against the car door, half-�asleep, mouth open.<br><br> He sighs.

She startles, looking at him wide-�eyed, and Jus can see everything about her that initially caught his attention. Melo&#x2019;s dad is this Hall of Fame NFL linebacker (biiiiig black dude), but her mom is from Norway. She got Mrs. Taylor&#x2019;s milky Norwegian complexion, wavy hair the color of honey, and amazing green eyes that are kind of purple around the edge, but she has really full lips, a small waist, crazy curvy hips, and probably the nicest butt Jus has ever seen in his life.<br><br> That&#x2019;s part of his problem: he gets too tripped up by how beautiful she is. He never would&#x2019;ve dreamed a girl as fine as her would be into him.<br><br> Now he&#x2019;s got the urge to kiss her even though her eyes are red and her hair&#x2019;s a mess and she smells like vodka and cigarettes and weed. But when he goes to push her hair out of her face, she shoves his hand away again. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t touch me, Justyce.&#x201d;<br><br> She starts shifting her stuff around on the ground&#x2014;�lipstick, Kleenex, tampons, one of those circular thingies with the makeup in one half and a mirror in the other, a flask. &#x201c;Ugh, where are my keeeeeeeys?&#x201d;<br><br> Justyce spots them in front of the back tire and snatches them up. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not driving, Melo.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Give &#x2019;em.&#x201d; She swipes for the keys but falls into his arms instead. Justyce props her against the car again and gathers the rest of her stuff to put it back in her bag&#x2014;�which is large enough to hold a week&#x2019;s worth of groceries (what is it with girls and purses the size of duffel bags?). He unlocks the car, tosses the bag on the floor of the backseat, and tries to get Melo up off the ground.<br><br> Then everything goes really wrong, really fast.<br><br> First, she throws up all over the hoodie Jus is wearing.<br><br> Which belongs to Manny. Who specifically said, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t come back here with throw-�up on my hoodie.&#x201d;<br><br> Perfect.<br><br> Jus takes off the sweatshirt and tosses it in the backseat.<br><br> When he tries to pick Melo up again, she slaps him. Hard. &#x201c;Leave me alone, Justyce,&#x201d; she says.<br><br> &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t do that, Mel. There&#x2019;s no way you&#x2019;ll make it home if you try to drive yourself.&#x201d;<br><br> He tries to lift her by the armpits and she spits in his face.<br><br> He considers walking away again. He could call her parents, stick her keys in his pocket, and bounce. Oak Ridge is probably the safest neighborhood in Atlanta. She&#x2019;d be fine for the twenty-�five minutes it would take Mr. Taylor to get here.<br><br> But he can&#x2019;t. Despite Manny&#x2019;s assertion that Melo needs to &#x201c;suffer some consequences for once,&#x201d; leaving her here all vulnerable doesn&#x2019;t seem like the right thing to do. So he picks her up and tosses her over his shoulder.<br><br> Melo responds in her usual delicate fashion: she screams and beats him on the back with her fists.<br><br> Justyce struggles to get the back door open and is lowering her into the car when he hears the WHOOOOP of a short siren and sees the blue lights. In the few seconds it takes the police car to screech to a stop behind him, Justyce settles Melo into the backseat.<br><br> Now she&#x2019;s gone catatonic.<br><br> Justyce can hear the approaching footsteps, but he stays focused on getting Melo strapped in. He wants it to be clear to the cop that she wasn&#x2019;t gonna drive so she won&#x2019;t be in even worse trouble.<br><br> Before he can get his head out of the car, he feels a tug on his shirt and is yanked backward. His head smacks the doorframe just before a hand clamps down on the back of his neck. His upper body slams onto the trunk with so much force, he bites the inside of his cheek, and his mouth fills with blood.<br><br> Jus swallows, head spinning, unable to get his bearings. The sting of cold metal around his wrists pulls him back to reality.<br><br> Handcuffs.<br><br> It hits him: Melo&#x2019;s drunk beyond belief in the backseat of a car she fully intended to drive, yet Jus is the one in handcuffs.<br><br> The cop shoves him to the ground beside the police cruiser as he asks if Justyce understands his rights. Justyce doesn&#x2019;t remember hearing any rights, but his ears had been ringing from the two blows to the head, so maybe he missed them. He swallows more blood.<br><br> &#x201c;Officer, this is a big misundersta&#x2014;�&#x201d; he starts to say, but he doesn&#x2019;t get to finish because the officer hits him in the face.<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you say shit to me, you son of a bitch. I knew your punk ass was up to no good when I saw you walking down the road with that goddamn hood on.&#x201d;<br><br> So the hood was a bad idea. Earbuds too. Probably would&#x2019;ve noticed he was being trailed without them. &#x201c;But, Officer, I&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You keep your mouth shut.&#x201d; The cop squats and gets right in Justyce&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;I know your kind: punks like you wander the streets of nice neighborhoods searching for prey. Just couldn&#x2019;t resist the pretty white girl who&#x2019;d locked her keys in her car, could ya?&#x201d;<br><br> Except that doesn&#x2019;t even make sense. If Mel had locked the keys in the car, Jus wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to get her inside it, would he? Justyce finds the officer&#x2019;s nameplate; castillo, it reads, though the guy looks like a regular white dude. Mama told him how to handle this type of situation, though he must admit he never expected to actually need the advice: Be respectful; keep the anger in check; make sure the police can see your hands (though that&#x2019;s impossible right now). &#x201c;Officer Castillo, I mean you no disresp&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I told your punk ass to shut the fuck up!&#x201d;<br><br> He wishes he could see Melo. Get her to tell this cop the truth. But the dude is blocking his view.<br><br> &#x201c;Now, if you know what&#x2019;s good for you, you won&#x2019;t move or speak. Resistance will only land you in deeper shit. Got it?&#x201d;<br><br> Cigarette breath and flecks of spit hit Justyce&#x2019;s face as the cop speaks, but Justyce fixes his gaze on the glowing green F of the FarmFresh sign.<br><br> &#x201c;Look at me when I&#x2019;m talking to you, boy.&#x201d; He grabs Justyce&#x2019;s chin. &#x201c;I asked you a question.&#x201d;<br><br> Justyce swallows. Meets the cold blue of Officer Castillo&#x2019;s eyes. Clears his throat.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes sir,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I got it.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Age of the Horse: An Equine Journey Through Human History</h2><p>Fifty-six million years ago, the proto-horse was a &#x201c;twelve-pound runt&#x201d; that balanced on feet with four toes. The first glimpse we have of what he looked like and how he was evolving are images found painted across the Paleolithic Lascaux Cave in southern France.<br><br> Anthropologist and equestrian expert Susanna Forrest presents a singular, sweeping panorama of the animal&#x2019;s prominent role across time and in societies around the world. Combining fascinating anthropological detail and incisive personal anecdotes, Forrest illustrates how our evolution has coincided with that of horses. She deftly synthesizes historical material with her experience in the field, traveling the globe to give us a diverse, comprehensive look at the horse in our lives today: from Mongolia where she observes the endangered takhi, to a show-horse performance at the Palace of Versailles and then to Arlington, Virginia, where veterans with PTSD are rehabilitated through interaction with horses.<br><br> Unique, passionate, and insightful, this book investigates the complexities of human and horse coexistence, brilliantly revealing the multifaceted ways our cultures were shaped by this powerful creature.</p><p><b>Susanna Forrest</b> lives in Berlin where she works as a writer and editor.

If the purpose of this course was to expose students to dangerous lightning and half the world&#x2019;s mosquitoes, it was fulfilled on the first day. What was in essence a forced march through hundreds of miles of backcountry culminated in a ritual known as &#x201c;the solo,&#x201d; where we were finally permitted to rest&#x2014;alone, on the outskirts of a gorgeous alpine lake&#x2014;for three days of fasting and contemplation.<br> <br>I had just turned sixteen, and this was my first taste of true solitude since exiting my mother&#x2019;s womb. It proved a sufficient provocation. After a long nap and a glance at the icy waters of the lake, the promising young man I imagined myself to be was quickly cut down by loneliness and boredom. I filled the pages of my journal not with the insights of a budding naturalist, philosopher, or mystic but with a list of the foods on which I intended to gorge myself the instant I returned to civilization. Judging from the state of my consciousness at the time, millions of years of hominid evolution had produced nothing more transcendent than a craving for a cheeseburger and a chocolate milkshake.<br> <br>I found the experience of sitting undisturbed for three days amid pristine breezes and starlight, with nothing to do but contemplate the mystery of my existence, to be a source of perfect misery&#x2014;for which I could see not so much as a glimmer of my own contribution. My letters home, in their plaintiveness and self-pity, rivaled any written at Shiloh or Gallipoli.<br> <br>So I was more than a little surprised when several members of our party, most of whom were a decade older than I, described their days and nights of solitude in positive, even transformational terms. I simply didn&#x2019;t know what to make of their claims to happiness. How could someone&#x2019;s happiness increase when all the material sources of pleasure and distraction had been removed? At that age, the nature of my own mind did not interest me&#x2014;only my life did. And I was utterly oblivious to how different life would be if the quality of my mind were to change.<br> <br>Our minds are all we have. They are all we have ever had. And they are all we can offer others. This might not be obvious, especially when there are aspects of your life that seem in need of improvement&#x2014;when your goals are unrealized, or you are struggling to find a career, or you have relationships that need repairing. But it&#x2019;s the truth. Every experience you have ever had has been shaped by your mind. Every relationship is as good or as bad as it is because of the minds involved. If you are perpetually angry, depressed, confused, and unloving, or your attention is elsewhere, it won&#x2019;t matter how successful you become or who is in your life&#x2014;you won&#x2019;t enjoy any of it.<br> <br>Most of us could easily compile a list of goals we want to achieve or personal problems that need to be solved. But what is the real significance of every item on such a list? Everything we want to accomplish&#x2014;to paint the house, learn a new language, find a better job&#x2014;is something that promises that, if done, it would allow us to finally relax and enjoy our lives in the present. Generally speaking, this is a false hope. I&#x2019;m not denying the importance of achieving one&#x2019;s goals, maintaining one&#x2019;s health, or keeping one&#x2019;s children clothed and fed&#x2014;but most of us spend our time seeking happiness and security without acknowledging the underlying purpose of our search. Each of us is looking for a path back to the present: We are trying to find good enough reasons to be satisfied now.<br> <br>Acknowledging that this is the structure of the game we are playing allows us to play it differently. How we pay attention to the present moment largely determines the character of our experience and, therefore, the quality of our lives. Mystics and contemplatives have made this claim for ages&#x2014;but a growing body of scientific research now bears it out.<br> <br>A few years after my first painful encounter with solitude, in the winter of 1987, I took the drug 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA), commonly known as Ecstasy, and my sense of the human mind&#x2019;s potential shifted profoundly. Although MDMA would become ubiquitous at dance clubs and &#x201c;raves&#x201d; in the 1990s, at that time I didn&#x2019;t know anyone of my generation who had tried it. One evening, a few months before my twentieth birthday, a close friend and I decided to take the drug.<br> <br>The setting of our experiment bore little resemblance to the conditions of Dionysian abandon under which MDMA is now often consumed. We were alone in a house, seated across from each other on opposite ends of a couch, and engaged in quiet conversation as the chemical worked its way into our heads. Unlike other drugs with which we were by then familiar (marijuana and alcohol), MDMA produced no feeling of distortion in our senses. Our minds seemed completely clear.<br> <br>In the midst of this ordinariness, however, I was suddenly struck by the knowledge that I loved my friend. This shouldn&#x2019;t have surprised me&#x2014;he was, after all, one of my best friends. However, at that age I was not in the habit of dwelling on how much I loved the men in my life. Now I could feel that I loved him, and this feeling had ethical implications that suddenly seemed as profound as they now sound pedestrian on the page: I wanted him to be happy.<br> <br>That conviction came crashing down with such force that something seemed to give way inside me. In fact, the insight appeared to restructure my mind. My capacity for envy, for instance&#x2014;the sense of being diminished by the happiness or success of another person&#x2014;seemed like a symptom of mental illness that had vanished without a trace. I could no more have felt envy at that moment than I could have wanted to poke out my own eyes. What did I care if my friend was better looking or a better athlete than I was? If I could have bestowed those gifts on him, I would have. Truly wanting him to be happy made his happiness my own.<br> <br>A certain euphoria was creeping into these reflections, perhaps, but the general feeling remained one of absolute sobriety&#x2014;and of moral and emotional clarity unlike any I had ever known. It would not be too strong to say that I felt sane for the first time in my life. And yet the change in my consciousness seemed entirely straightforward. I was simply talking to my friend&#x2014;about what, I don&#x2019;t recall&#x2014;and realized that I had ceased to be concerned about myself. I was no longer anxious, self-critical, guarded by irony, in competition, avoiding embarrassment, ruminating about the past and future, or making any other gesture of thought or attention that separated me from him. I was no longer watching myself through another person&#x2019;s eyes.<br> <br>And then came the insight that irrevocably transformed my sense of how good human life could be. I was feeling boundless love for one of my best friends, and I suddenly realized that if a stranger had walked through the door at that moment, he or she would have been fully included in this love. Love was at bottom impersonal&#x2014;and deeper than any personal history could justify. Indeed, a transactional form of love&#x2014;I love you because&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#x2014;now made no sense at all.<br> <br>The interesting thing about this final shift in perspective was that it was not driven by any change in the way I felt. I was not overwhelmed by a new feeling of love. The insight had more the character of a geometric proof: It was as if, having glimpsed the properties of one set of parallel lines, I suddenly understood what must be common to them all.<br> <br>The moment I could find a voice with which to speak, I discovered that this epiphany about the universality of love could be readily communicated. My friend got the point at once: All I had to do was ask him how he would feel in the presence of a total stranger at that moment, and the same door opened in his mind. It was simply obvious that love, compassion, and joy in the joy of others extended without limit. The experience was not of love growing but of its being no longer obscured. Love was&#x2014;as advertised by mystics and crackpots through the ages&#x2014;a state of being. How had we not seen this before? And how could we overlook it ever again?<br> <br>It would take me many years to put this experience into context. Until that moment, I had viewed organized religion as merely a monument to the ignorance and superstition of our ancestors. But I now knew that Jesus, the Buddha, Lao Tzu, and the other saints and sages of history had not all been epileptics, schizophrenics, or frauds. I still considered the world&#x2019;s religions to be mere intellectual ruins, maintained at enormous economic and social cost, but I now understood that important psychological truths could be found in the rubble.<br> <br>Twenty percent of Americans describe themselves as &#x201c;spiritual but not religious.&#x201d; Although the claim seems to annoy believers and atheists equally, separating spirituality from religion is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. It is to assert two important truths simultaneously: Our world is dangerously riven by religious doctrines that all educated people should condemn, and yet there is more to understanding the human condition than science and secular culture generally admit. One purpose of this book is to give both these convictions intellectual and empirical support.<br> <br>Before going any further, I should address the animosity that many readers feel toward the term spiritual. Whenever I use the word, as in referring to meditation as a &#x201c;spiritual practice,&#x201d; I hear from fellow skeptics and atheists who think that I have committed a grievous error.<br> <br>The word spirit comes from the Latin spiritus, which is a translation of the Greek pneuma, meaning &#x201c;breath.&#x201d; Around the thirteenth century, the term became entangled with beliefs about immaterial souls, supernatural beings, ghosts, and so forth. It acquired other meanings as well: We speak of the spirit of a thing as its most essential principle or of certain volatile substances and liquors as spirits. Nevertheless, many nonbelievers now consider all things &#x201c;spiritual&#x201d; to be contaminated by medieval superstition.<br> <br>I do not share their semantic concerns.1 Yes, to walk the aisles of any &#x201c;spiritual&#x201d; bookstore is to confront the yearning and credulity of our species by the yard, but there is no other term&#x2014;apart from the even more problematic mystical or the more restrictive contemplative&#x2014;with which to discuss the efforts people make, through meditation, psychedelics, or other means, to fully bring their minds into the present or to induce nonordinary states of consciousness. And no other word links this spectrum of experience to our ethical lives.<br> <br>Throughout this book, I discuss certain classically spiritual phenomena, concepts, and practices in the context of our modern understanding of the human mind&#x2014;and I cannot do this while restricting myself to the terminology of ordinary experience. So I will use spiritual, mystical, contemplative, and transcendent without further apology. However, I will be precise in describing the experiences and methods that merit these terms.<br> <br>For many years, I have been a vocal critic of religion, and I won&#x2019;t ride the same hobbyhorse here. I hope that I have been sufficiently energetic on this front that even my most skeptical readers will trust that my bullshit detector remains well calibrated as we advance over this new terrain. Perhaps the following assurance can suffice for the moment: Nothing in this book needs to be accepted on faith. Although my focus is on human subjectivity&#x2014;I am, after all, talking about the nature of experience itself&#x2014;all my assertions can be tested in the laboratory of your own life. In fact, my goal is to encourage you to do just that.<br> <br>Authors who attempt to build a bridge between science and spirituality tend to make one of two mistakes: Scientists generally start with an impoverished view of spiritual experience, assuming that it must be a grandiose way of describing ordinary states of mind&#x2014;parental love, artistic inspiration, awe at the beauty of the night sky. In this vein, one finds Einstein&#x2019;s amazement at the intelligibility of Nature&#x2019;s laws described as though it were a kind of mystical insight.<br> <br>New Age thinkers usually enter the ditch on the other side of the road: They idealize altered states of consciousness and draw specious connections between subjective experience and the spookier theories at the frontiers of physics. Here we are told that the Buddha and other contemplatives anticipated modern cosmology or quantum mechanics and that by transcending the sense of self, a person can realize his identity with the One Mind that gave birth to the cosmos.<br> <br>In the end, we are left to choose between pseudo-spirituality and pseudo-science.<br> <br>Few scientists and philosophers have developed strong skills of introspection&#x2014;in fact, most doubt that such abilities even exist. Conversely, many of the greatest contemplatives know nothing about science. But there is a connection between scientific fact and spiritual wisdom, and it is more direct than most people suppose. Although the insights we can have in meditation tell us nothing about the origins of the universe, they do confirm some well-established truths about the human mind: Our conventional sense of self is an illusion; positive emotions, such as compassion and patience, are teachable skills; and the way we think directly influences our experience of the world.<br> <br>There is now a large literature on the psychological benefits of meditation. Different techniques produce long-lasting changes in attention, emotion, cognition, and pain perception, and these correlate with both structural and functional changes in the brain. This field of research is quickly growing, as is our understanding of self-awareness and related mental phenomena. Given recent advances in neuroimaging technology, we no longer face a practical impediment to investigating spiritual insights in the context of science.<br> <br>Spirituality must be distinguished from religion&#x2014;because people of every faith, and of none, have had the same sorts of spiritual experiences. While these states of mind are usually interpreted through the lens of one or another religious doctrine, we know that this is a mistake. Nothing that a Christian, a Muslim, and a Hindu can experience&#x2014;self-transcending love, ecstasy, bliss, inner light&#x2014;constitutes evidence in support of their traditional beliefs, because their beliefs are logically incompatible with one another. A deeper principle must be at work.<br> <br>That principle is the subject of this book: The feeling that we call &#x201c;I&#x201d; is an illusion. There is no discrete self or ego living like a Minotaur in the labyrinth of the brain. And the feeling that there is&#x2014;the sense of being perched somewhere behind your eyes, looking out at a world that is separate from yourself&#x2014;can be altered or entirely extinguished. Although such experiences of &#x201c;self-transcendence&#x201d; are generally thought about in religious terms, there is nothing, in principle, irrational about them. From both a scientific and a philosophical point of view, they represent a clearer understanding of the way things are. Deepening that understanding, and repeatedly cutting through the illusion of the self, is what is meant by &#x201c;spirituality&#x201d; in the context of this book.<br> <br>Confusion and suffering may be our birthright, but wisdom and happiness are available. The landscape of human experience includes deeply transformative insights about the nature of one&#x2019;s own consciousness, and yet it is obvious that these psychological states must be understood in the context of neuroscience, psychology, and related fields....</p><h2>Flight From Woman</h2><p><p>Dr. Stern&#x2019;s <em>The Flight from Woman</em> is a study of the polarity of the sexes as reflected in the conflict between two modes of knowledge&#x2013;scientific or rational, as contrasted with intuitive or poetic. In exploring this rich theme, he undertakes the psychological portraits of six representative figures whose thought and work have influenced modern man: Descartes, Goethe, Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, Tolstoy, and Sartre.</p> <p>The scientific revolution of the last 300 years has yielded, in Dr. Stern&#x2019;s view, a de-ferninization and de-humanization of society, in the sense that it is a rejection of the kind of wisdom, called sophia, that is comprehended intuitively. &#x201c;If we equate the one-sidedly rational and technical with the masculine,&#x201d; he states, &#x201c;there arises the ghastly specter of a world impoverished of womanly values.&#x201d;</p> <p>A deeply original work, <em>The Flight from Woman</em> goes far beyond psychology in its analysis of the malaise of our time. </p></p><p>Karl Stern was born in Bavaria in 1906, to socially assimilated Jewish parents. He studied medicine in Munich, Berlin and Frankfurt, specializig in psychiatric research. He emigrated from Nazi Germany in 1936, finding work in neurological research in England, and later as lecturer in neuropathology and assistant neuropathologist at the Montreal Neurological Institute. In 1943, after much soul-searching, and ultimately influenced by encounters with Jacques Maritain and Dorothy Day, Stern received baptism as a Catholic."One of the most important books of our times, it seems to me. Dr. Stern reads like a poet, and uses his professional training in order to arrive at profound insights, instead of being hamstrung by it, as most Freudian literary critics are."--Caroline Gordon<br><br>"A Freudian psychiatrist of Jewish birth, a Roman Catholic and a mean of letters--this is a unique and remarkable combination. Admirers of The Pillar of Fire and The Third Revolution will find even greater insight and compassion in Dr Stern's new hook exploring the hidden sources of anti-feminist writing in Europe from Schopenhauer to Sartre."--Graham Greene</p><h2>Min Makes a Machine (I Like to Read)</h2><p><b>Budding engineer Min uses her skills to save the day in this Level E easy reader, perfect for Kindergarten students to read on their own! </b><br><br> Min wants to play, but Ann and Bess say it's too hot to do anything.

A white family from a notoriously racist neighborhood in the suburbs and a black family from its poorest ward cross Houston's color line, overcoming humiliation, degradation, and violence to win the freedom of five black college students unjustly charged with the murder of a policeman. </p><p><i>The Silence of Our Friends </i>follows events through the point of view of young Mark Long, whose father is a reporter covering the story. Semi-fictionalized, this story has its roots solidly in very real events. With art from the brilliant Nate Powell (<i>Swallow Me Whole</i>) bringing the tale to heart-wrenching life, <i>The Silence of Our Friends </i>is a new and important entry in the body of civil rights literature.</p><p><b>The Silence of Our Friends Author Q&amp;A</b></p><p><b>How much of this book's story is based on real events? </b></p><br><br><p>Mark Long: Creating a book like this one required us to find a balance between factual accuracy and emotional authenticity. Some details as well as names have been changed for storytelling purposes. But the facts are that in 1967 Texas Southern University students began a boycott of classes after the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee was banned from campus, and on May 17th they staged a sit down protest on Wheeler Avenue over conditions at the nearby city garbage dump. The protest evolved into an police riot that night when an undercover officer was shot and over 200 officers responded by pouring rifle and machinegun fire into the men's dormitory. The police later stormed the dormitory and arrested 489 students after a policeman was shot and killed. All but 5 of the students were released the next day. They came to be called the "TSU Five" and were charged with the murder of the slain officer. Only one of the students stood trial in Victoria Texas due to publicity in Houston. His trial ended with the dismissal of all charges against the five when it was discovered that the officer was shot accidentally by another officer.</p><br><br><p><b>With the civil rights struggle as a backdrop to the story, how did you balance a contemporary perspective on race with the reality of race issues at the time? </b></p><br><br><p>Nate Powell: While visualizing and adapting Mark's largely autobiographical work on the story, I found myself calling on my own experiences as a kid in Alabama, Mississippi, and Arkansas in the 1980's. Though the story takes place in a specific historical framework, many of the attitudes, details, atmospheric elements, and anecdotes were extremely familiar to me -- sometimes too familiar. As the pages progressed, the twenty years between our Southern childhood experiences didn't seem like much of a difference at all, which was certainly disturbing at times. </p><p>There were frequent case-by-case conversations about accurate depictions of racism, the privilege of authorship, and inherent charge carried by racism's role in the book. Generally speaking, we determined that this <i>was</i> in many ways a brutal story but a very <i>accurate</i> one, and respecting the very real violence carried by certain words and actions allowed us to give them their ugly space in the narrative, for better or for worse.</p><br><br><p><b>Is much knowledge of the civil rights movement required? </b></p><br><br><p>Mark Long: Everything that pushes the narrative forward is contained within the story's pages, and a lot of the civil rights and struggle-related content is specific to Houston in 1967-68. It definitely covers what readers might need to know without having expertise on the civil rights movement. Having said that, however, I think readers are rewarded throughout the book as characters are offered windows through which they witness a much more massive social upheaval, framed within the last few months of Dr. Martin Luther King's too-short life. </p><br><br><p><b>There's no easy way to categorize this book, how would you describe it? </b></p><p>Mark Long: I'd say it's a culture's own coming-of-age tale. By that, I mean it's first and foremost an exploration of shifting boundaries: towns and neighborhoods, friends and families, customs and attitudes all on the threshold of massive (and ongoing) change. The boundaries themselves take on lives of their own at times. In a more traditional sense, it's also equal parts a story centering on two families' internal relationships as they find themselves in each other's orbit, struggle narrative, friendship-betrayal tale, and courtroom drama.</p><br><br><p><b>Why choose to tell this story in a graphic format?</b></p><br><br><p>Nate Powell: As the story's climax is dependent on sorting through multiple points of view, it's appropriate that comics are ideal medium by which to tell a tale with so many lenses. The book offers a pretty intimate view of the world through main characters' points of view, but bringing the narrative even closer through Mark's eyes and balancing them all without judgment highlight the strengths of comics storytelling.</p></p><p><b>Mark Long </b>is a video game designer and producer living in Seattle. <i>The Silence of Our Friends </i>is based on Long's childhood experiences with the civil rights movement in suburban Houston, Texas. <b>Jim Demonakos </b>founded Seattle's annual Emerald City Comicon, as well as The Comic Stop chain of retail stores.

He places us on the outcrops, rock hammer in hand, to examine the evidence for how these rough-hewn lands came to be. We see California and its gold assembled from pieces of old ocean floor and the relentless movements of the Earth&#x2019;s tectonic plates. We witness the birth of the Rockies. And we investigate the violent earthquakes that continue to shape the region today. Into the West&#x2019;s geologic story, Meldahl also weaves its human history.

Defined as the participation of all of the people in at least some aspects of self-government at least some of the time, <i>Strong Democracy </i>offers liberal society a new way of thinking about and of practicing democracy. Contrary to the commonly held view that an excess of democracy can undo liberal institutions, Barber argues that an excess of liberalism has undermined our democratic institutions and brought about the set of crises we still find ourselves struggling against: cynicism about voting, alienation, privatization, and the growing paralysis of public institutions.

Kuhn's argument that scientific knowledge does not develop cumulatively, but rather proceeds by a series of "paradigm shifts," captivated not only philosophers of science, but scholars in a wide range of academic disciplines. <i>The Road Since Structure</i> is a follow-up to his landmark work and a look at Kuhn's theory since the book's original publication in 1962. <p> In keeping with Kuhn's wishes (he died in 1996), editors James Conant and John Haugeland organized <i>The Road Since Structure</i> to include 11 philosophical essays written since 1970. In the first part of the book, Kuhn spells out his theory as it developed in the 1980s and 1990s; in the second part, he replies to a number of criticisms and misreadings. The third section is a fascinating interview with Kuhn conducted less than a year before he died. For general interest readers, the lengthy interview--in which Kuhn candidly and engagingly discusses the trials and tribulations of his life and philosophical career--will probably be the most interesting part of the book. For those attuned to Kuhn's controversial work, <i>The Road Since Structure</i> is an indispensable aid for understanding his theory as it developed and for appreciating the full force of his replies to a host of critical objections. As always, Kuhn's clarity and fluid prose render accessible a field fraught with opaque writing. <i>--Eric de Place</i></p>Thomas Kuhn's <i>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i>, published in 1962, is one of the most important works of our time. It has been translated into twenty five languages, and the English edition alone has sold more than one million copies. <i>Structure</i> established Kuhn as the century's most influential philosopher of science, but during the last twenty years of his life, Kuhn was radically rethinking the central concepts of that work. When he died in 1996, he left an unfinished sequel to <i>Structure</i> and a plan for a collection of essays written since 1970.<br><br>Divided into three parts, <i>The Road since Structure</i> is the fullest record we now have of the new direction Kuhn was taking during the last two decades of his life. The first part of the book consists of essays, philosophical rather than historical in nature, in which Kuhn refines the basic concepts set forth in <i>Structure&#x2014;paradigm</i> shifts, incommensurability, and the nature of scientific progress. In part two, Kuhn replies at length to criticisms of his earlier work. Here the reader will find Kuhn arguing his position with some of the most significant philosophers of the time, including Paul Feyerabend and Karl Popper. <br><br>The third part of the volume is the transcript of a remarkable autobiographical interview with Kuhn conducted in Athens in 1995, not quite a year before his death. Here, the usually reticent Kuhn discusses his own intellectual development&#x2014;his family and upbringing, his education, the influence of his training as a physicist, his war work, his relations with his colleagues, the responses to<i> Structure&#x2014;as</i> well as his struggles to define his philosophical position both before and after that landmark work. <br><br><i>The Road since Structure</i> is the definitive companion to <i>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i>. Forceful and accessible, it illuminates and further develops Kuhn's classic book, and it will intrigue everyone who has been engaged by <i>Structure</i> and the debates it launched. In it they will find the story not only of Kuhn's development but also of the man himself.</p><h2>Firearms: A Global History to 1700</h2><p>Kenneth Chase traces the history of firearms from their invention in China in the 1100s to the 1700s, when European firearms had become clearly superior. In Firearms, Chase asks why it was the Europeans who perfected firearms, not the Chinese, and answers this question by looking at how firearms were used throughout the world. Early firearms were restricted to infantry and siege warfare, limiting their use outside of Europe and Japan. Steppe and desert nomads imposed a different style of warfare on the Middle East, India, and China--a style incompatible with firearms. By the time that better firearms allowed these regions to turn the tables on the nomads, Japan&#39;s self-imposed isolation left Europe with no rival in firearms design, production, or use, with lasting consequences. After earning his doctorate from Harvard in the area of East Asian Languages and Civilizations and traveling extensively in Asia, Kenneth Chase pursued a career in the law. His interest in history endures unabated, however, and after nine years of research on firearms, he is now working on a history of international trade in the Indian Ocean region in the 1300s and 1400s.</p><p>This book is a history of firearms across the world from the 1100s up to the 1700s, from the time of their invention in China to the time when European firearms had become clearly superior. It asks why it was the Europeans who perfected firearms when it was the Chinese who had invented them, but it answers this question by looking at how firearms were used throughout the world.Kenneth W.

Stephen Greenblatt examines the structure of selfhood as evidenced in major literary figures of the English Renaissance&#x2014;More, Tyndale, Wyatt, Spenser, Marlowe, and Shakespeare&#x2014;and finds that in the early modern period new questions surrounding the nature of identity heavily influenced the literature of the era. Now a classic text in literary studies, <i>Renaissance Self-Fashioning</i> continues to be of interest to students of the Renaissance, English literature, and the new historicist tradition, and this new edition includes a preface by the author on the book's creation and influence.<br> <br> "No one who has read [Greenblatt's] accounts of More, Tyndale, Wyatt, and others can fail to be moved, as well as enlightened, by an interpretive mode which is as humane and sympathetic as it is analytical. These portraits are poignantly, subtly, and minutely rendered in a beautifully lucid prose alive in every sentence to the ambivalences and complexities of its subjects."&#x2014;Harry Berger Jr., University of California, Santa Cruz</p></p><p><p><b>Stephen Greenblatt</b> is the John Cogan University Professor of the Humanities at Harvard University. He is the author of many books, including <i>Hamlet in Purgatory</i>, <i>Will in the World: How Shakespeare Became Shakespeare</i>, and <i>The Swerve: How the World Became Modern</i>, winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award.</p>&nbsp;"One day we were teaching Renaissance literature to small groups of somewhat bored students, the next "Renaissance Self-Fashioning "had appeared, and suddenly studying the Renaissance was all the rage, exciting and new. Stephen Greenblatt's book entirely altered the critical landscape-showing with compelling lucidity that social anthropology and psychoanalysis were essential tools for understanding Renaissance writing. I can't think of any other critical work since T. S. Eliot to have made that kind of impact."<br></p><h2>Professional Responsibility, Problems and Materials, Unabridged (University Casebook Series)</h2><p>Continuing the tradition that has made it a leader in its field, this casebook uses problems to provide an overview of lawyers' professional responsibility. One of the most rapidly changing fields in American law, professional responsibility sees new issues, rules and cases each year, all of which are covered in this book. The authors have carefully designed this Thirteenth Edition to be familiar to long time users, and accessible to new ones. It continues its tradition of offering the most usable and up-to-date course materials to teach legal ethics and the law governing the practice of law.<br><br>The new Thirteenth Edition provides resources to help law teachers address the many changes in the legal profession and professional responsibility law since the last edition in 2014. Among those changes are:<br><ul><li>ABA adoption of Model Rule 8.4(g) that forbids "harassment or discrimination by lawyers on the basis of race, sex, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status or socioeconomic status in conduct related to the practice of law."</li><li>Efforts to expand the availability of legal services to poor and middle-income persons who do not now use lawyers.</li><li>Changing methods of delivering legal services, both those used by traditional law firms and services proposed by non-traditional providers.</li><li>Changes in discovery rules and other procedural requirements that create new lawyer obligations to opponents and the court.</li><li>Efforts to simplify and clarify rules relating to lawyer marketing.</li><li>Use of judicial ethics rules to define Constitutional due process requirements that lawyers may raise on behalf of their clients.</li></ul></p><p></p><h2>Law and Bioethics: An Introduction (Not In A Series)</h2><p>While the American legal system has played an important role in shaping the field of bioethics, <i>Law and Bioethics</i> is the first book on the subject designed to be accessible to readers with little or no legal background. Detailing how the legal analysis of an issue in bioethics often differs from the "ethical" analysis, the book covers such topics as abortion, surrogacy, cloning, informed consent, malpractice, refusal of care, and organ transplantation. <br><br>Structured like a legal casebook, <i>Law and Bioethics</i> includes the text of almost all the landmark cases that have shaped bioethics. Jerry Menikoff offers commentary on each of these cases, as well as a lucid introduction to the U.S. legal system, explaining federalism and underlying common law concepts. Students and professionals in medicine and public health, as well as specialists in bioethics, will find the book a valuable resource.</p><p><b>Jerry Menikoff</b> is an assistant professor of law, ethics, and medicine at the University of Kansas.<p>"It's all here&#x2015;the most important legal cases in bioethics accompanied by lucid commentary....Menikoff has organized the materials in a manner than makes abundantly clear how the law and bioethics have developed. I cannot think of a better introduction to the topic."&#x2015;Peter A. Ubel, MD, University of Michigan and Ann Arbor Veterans Affairs Medical Center</p><p>"A comprehensive and carefully structured examination of bioethics and of the law's response . . . will inspire virtually every reader to think again about the issues at stake in the contemporary bioethical debate."&#x2015;Janet Dolgin, Hofstra University</p><p>"A well-written, engaging, and comprehensive casebook."&#x2015;Mark Siegler, MD, Director, MacLean Center for Clinical Medical Ethics, The University of Chicago</p></p><h2>The Embers and the Stars a Philosophical Inquiry into the Moral Sense of Nature</h2><p><p>"It is hard to put this profound book into a category. Despite the author's criticisms of Thoreau, it is more like <i>Walden</i> than any other book I have read. . . . The book makes great strides toward bringing the best insights from medieval philosophy and from contemporary environmental ethics together. Anyone interested in both of these areas must read this book."&#x2014;Daniel A. Dombrowski, <i>The Thomist</i><br> <br> "Those who share Koh�k's concern to understand nature as other than a mere resource or matter in motion will find his temporally oriented interpretation of nature instructive. It is here in particular that Koh�k turns moments of experience to account philosophically, turning what we habitually overlook or avoid into an opportunity and basis for self-knowledge. This is an impassioned attempt to see the vital order of nature and the moral order of our humanity as one."&#x2014;<i>Ethics</i></p></p><p>The quest of this volume is one of recalling what we have thus hidden from ourselves. It is a philosopher&#39;s book, deeply indebted to the cultural heritage of three millennia of Western thought. It is also a book of philosophy, though in a sense far older than the current acceptation of that term.<b>Erazim Koh�k</b> is professor of philosophy at Boston University.

Parnell, and John E. Spillan helps readers understand the importance of planning for crises within the wider framework of an organization&#x2032;s regular strategic management process. This strikingly engaging and easy-to-follow text focuses on a four-stage crisis management framework: 1) Landscape Survey: identifying potential crisis vulnerabilities, 2) Strategic Planning: organizing the crisis management team and writing the plan, 3) Crisis Management: addressing the crisis when it occurs, and 4) Organizational Learning: applying lessons from crises so they will be prevented or mitigated in the future.</p><p><p>William &#x201c;Rick&#x201d; Crandall (PhD, University of Memphis) is professor of Management at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. Previously, Dr Crandall taught for eleven years at Concord College, Athens, where he served on the college&#x2019;s crisis management team.

His research interests center on crisis management, international marketing, entrepreneurship, and international business. His articles have appeared in a wide range of journals.</p>&#x201c;I really like [Crisis Management]. It is very readable and interesting. It is able to explain things clearly without being too basic for the more experienced reader...There is more &#x2032;content&#x2032; and more different approaches and perspectives than in other crisis management books. Other books seem repetitive, dry and one-note by comparison.&#x201d; Author: Stephen C. Betts Published On: 2013-01-03<br><br>&#x201c;I LOVE the basic premise: that crisis management should be integrated with strategic management. That beautifully underlies the authors&#x2032; preferred framework, which in turn drives the text&#x2032;s organization and content. Too often, courses and texts are developed in silos, with strategic management being separated from organization theory and organization behavior and so on...This text takes an interdisciplinary approach to a set of critical problems that managers must consider and resolve in order to protect the interests of their employees, organizations, and communities.&#x201d; Author: Lucy A. Arendt Published On: 2013-01-03<br><br>&#x201c;I think the level of writing and presentation is excellent.&#x201d; Author: Karen M. Leonard Published On: 2013-01-03<br><br>&#x201c;The book was easy for [my students] to read and understand. It also provided good mini cases...The exercises and mini cases were very useful. However, the overall readability for students is what I found impressive and why I chose this book over others in the market.&#x201d; Author: Tami Moser Published On: 2013-01-03<br><br>&#x201c;Overall, I found the Crandall, Parnell and Spillan book appropriate in scope (not overly broad and general, but also not clearly narrow and specific). They focused in on essential information for an introductory book on crisis management, and the reader should be well informed just by reading this book. The writing style was straightforward, concise and business-like, with a professional conversational tone. I liked it, and found it easy to read this book and to stay engaged with the material. I think students will find it interesting, comprehensible, and appealing to read.&#x201d; Author: Marcia J. Kurzynski Lock Haven Published On: 2013-01-03<br><br>&#x201c;This book offers a logical and theoretical framework for crisis management, depicted in a visual model that is explained with real-world examples. The book expertly blends theory with real-world application in a manner that simply makes sense. Such an approach is extremely valuable when planning for crises as well as teaching how to plan for crises...The chapters then have a very real-world approach so the amount of theory is perfect!&#x201d; Author: Dana Moore Gray Published On: 2013-01-03<br><br>&#x201c;Excellent! That&#x2032;s why I have selected it as my text. The incorporation of strategy emphasizes the importance of crisis planning. It covers most of what I have traditionally emphasized in my courses. I particularly like its structure, breaking the process into stages and internal and external landscape. The text also covers the entire process of crisis management from sources and early warning to recovery...It covers the sequential unfolding of crises and as such, matches the way I teach and consult on CM. Very nicely done!&#x201d; Author: David X.

However Venn-Thomas is starting to find life among the New Cretans rather dull. He comes to realize that their perfect existence, inspired by the poets and magicians of their strange occultic religion, lacks one fundamental thing - evil. So Venn-Thomas sees it as nothing less than his duty to introduce them to the darker side of life. First published in 1949 and also known as Watch the North Wind Rise, Graves&#39;s novel is a thrilling blend of utopian fantasy, science fiction and mythology.</p><p>Robert Graves was born in 1895 in Wimbledon. He went from school to the First World War, where he became a captain in the Royal Welch Fusiliers and was seriously wounded at the Battle of the Somme. He wrote his autobiography, Goodbye to All That, in 1929, and it was soon established as a modern classic. He died on 7 December 1985 in Majorca, his home since 1929.No one else offers his precise combination of eroticism, nightmare and epigram * Guardian *</p><h2>The Little Prince</h2><p><p>&nbsp;The story is philosophical and includes social criticism of the adult world. It was written during a period when Saint-Exup�ry fled to North America subsequent to the Fall of France during the Second World War, witnessed first hand by the author and captured in his memoir Flight to Arras. The adult fable, according to one review, is actually "...an allegory of Saint-Exup�ry's own life&#x2014;his search for childhood certainties and interior peace, his mysticism, his belief in human courage and brotherhood, and his deep love for his wife Consuelo but also an allusion to the tortured nature of their relationship."<br> Though ostensibly styled as a children's book, The Little Prince makes several observations about life and human nature. For example, Saint-Exup�ry tells of a fox meeting the young prince during his travels on Earth. The story's essence is contained in the fox saying that "One sees clearly only with the heart. The essential is invisible to the eye."&nbsp; Other key morals articulated by the fox are: "You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed," and "It is the time you have lost for your rose that makes your rose so important." The fox's messages are arguably the book's most famous quotations because they deal with human relationships.</p></p><p><p>"Here, Little Prince fans is the definitive edition.

Turner offers a creative, richly grounded reinterpretation of social evolution.</p><p><b>Jonathan H. Turner</b> is Distinguished Professor of Sociology at University of California, Riverside. Among his many influential books is the recently published <i>Face to Face: Toward a Sociological Theory of Interpersonal Behavior</i> (2002).This is a stunning achievement by a first-rate scholar and social theorist. Highly recommended. (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>[Turner's] book is an excellent contribution to the theoretical literature on social evolution. Turner has an excellent feel for how the process of long-term social evolution works, both descriptively and in terms of the key casual forces. His book should be read far and wide. (<i>American Journal of Sociology</i>)<br><br>Using innovative methods, concepts, and notations developed in his earlier works, and eschewing a 'prime mover,' Turner outlines a cogent and comprehensive macro-level theory of social organization and social change. Avoiding the pitfalls of earlier functional analyses of social institutions and social order, the theory identifies the key 'macro-dynamic' forces that shape and alter the 'institutional order,' and it proposes general models of their impact, and of the patterned interrelationships, and mutual causality among the key institutions of societies.

As its subtitle suggests, <em>Adeline Mowbray, or The Mother and Daughter</em> begins and ends with their story, but its complex plot encompasses almost every other human relationship. This engaging novel explores many issues important in the Romantic period, from women&#x2019;s education to the ethics of slavery and colonialism. </p> <p> This Broadview Edition uses the first edition of 1805 as its copy text, but also includes important variants from the 1810 and 1844 editions. The appendices include contemporary reviews and material expanding on the novel&#x2019;s themes of women&#x2019;s education, marriage, slavery, and the tension between feeling and reason. </p></p><p><p> <strong>Anne McWhir</strong> is Professor of English at the University of Calgary.

It also pays notable attention to the author&#x2019;s revisions of the text over the course of the nineteenth century, thus leading us to consider the ways in which conventions associated with the Victorian novel evolve out of Romantic-era fiction.&#x201d; &#x2015; Roxanne Eberle, University of Georgia </p></p><h2>On Reading Ruskin (Prefaces to La Bible D&#39;Amiens and Sesame Et Les Lys, with Se)</h2><p>Early in his career, Marcel Proust, who greatly admired John Ruskin, published translations of two works by the English critic &#x2013; <i>La Bible d&#x2019;Amiens </i>(1900) and <i>S�same et les Lys </i>(1906). He wrote a substantial preface to each book and provided discursive notes that were themselves often small essays. Rare now, even in their French versions, the preface to <i>La Bible d&#x2019;Amiens </i>and the notes to both books have never before been available in English. In bringing them together with the preface to <i>S�same et les Lys</i>, this new book completes the translation into English of the important critical writings of Proust. <br>"Expertly edited and translated and . . . introduced by a brilliant forty-page essay and a fascinating bibliographical note by Richard Macksey. It is an event for celebration. . . . Proust emerges from these essays and notes as one of the truly great critics."&#x2015;Gabriel Josipovici, <i>Times Literary Supplement</i><i></i><br>"A welcome addition to English-language Proust texts and, I think, one long overdue."&#x2015;Germain Br�e, Kenan Professor Emerita, Wake Forest University&nbsp;<br></p><p>Text: English, French (translation)Though Proust knew no English, his admiration of John Ruskin inspired him to translate two of the critic's works The Bible of Amiens and Sesame and Lilies. To each Proust contributed a preface and extensive notes, made available here in English for the first time. The young novelist was deeply affected by Ruskin's "religion of beauty," especially the notion that the artist must submit totally to the work of art within him. After a six-year apprenticeship, Proust was ready to dedicate himself to his life's work A la recherche du temps perdu. Macksey's introduction re-creates this important period in the artist's development, and the translators' graceful prose preserves the flavor of Proust's original commentaries. An entirely different view of Proust is afforded by Nemerov's collection of 12 lectures delivered to undergraduates at Brandeis in 1968. The lectures are presented with their "warts unremoved," which means they are uneven, often dated, and tell us as much about Nemerov's teaching experience as they do about the themes in Proust's novel. A first-time Proust reader might better explore other sources as a guide to Proust's great work.

Some people feel passionately about the child obesity epidemic and support government regulation of sugary drinks. Others argue that people should be able to eat and drink whatever they like. Some people are alarmed about climate change and favor aggressive government intervention. Others don't feel the need for any sort of climate regulation. In <i>The Cost-Benefit Revolution</i>, Cass Sunstein argues our major disagreements really involve facts, not values. It follows that government policy should not be based on public opinion, intuitions, or pressure from interest groups, but on numbers&#x2015;meaning careful consideration of costs and benefits. Will a policy save one life, or one thousand lives? Will it impose costs on consumers, and if so, will the costs be high or negligible? Will it hurt workers and small businesses, and, if so, precisely how much?</p><p>As the Obama administration's &#x201c;regulatory czar,&#x201d; Sunstein knows his subject in both theory and practice. Drawing on behavioral economics and his well-known emphasis on &#x201c;nudging,&#x201d; he celebrates the cost-benefit revolution in policy making, tracing its defining moments in the Reagan, Clinton, and Obama administrations (and pondering its uncertain future in the Trump administration). He acknowledges that public officials often lack information about costs and benefits, and outlines state-of-the-art techniques for acquiring that information. Policies should make people's lives better. Quantitative cost-benefit analysis, Sunstein argues, is the best available method for making this happen&#x2015;even if, in the future, new measures of human well-being, also explored in this book, may be better still.</p></p><p>Cass R. Sunstein, Robert Walmsley University Professor at Harvard Law School, was Administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Obama administration. He was the recipient of the 2018 Holberg Prize, one of the largest annual international research prizes awarded to scholars who have made outstanding contributions to research in the arts and humanities, social science, law, or theology. He is the author of <i>The Cost-Benefit Revolution</i> (MIT Press), <i>Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness</i> (with Richard H. Thaler), and other books.<p>One of the very best Cass Sunstein books, the product of decades of reflection, remarkably well thought out on every page to an extent which is rare these days.</p>&#x2015;<i>Marginal Revolution</i><br><br><p>In the excellent historical sections describing the (non-partisan) spread of CBA in US government, Sunstein gives some persuasive examples of how to use CBA well... It's worth the read for anyone interested in the role of reason in policy making.</p>&#x2015;<i>Diane Coyle, The Enlightened Economist</i><br><br><p>Clear, well-argued....As Sunstein notes, cost-benefit models have become progressively less wrong and more useful over time, and will surely continue to improve. The cost-benefit revolution may be incomplete and its pace of progress uncertain, but it's far from over. �Viva la revoluci�n!</p>&#x2015;<i>Forbes Online</i><br><br><p>The book makes three valuable contributions: it relates the history of cost-benefit analysis in US policymaking; it tackles the economist Friedrich Hayek's argument that technocrats simply don't know enough to weigh costs and benefits; and it makes a case that cost-benefit analysis could reduce political tribalism.</p>&#x2015;<i>Financial Times</i><br><br><p>[Sunstein's] insights and conclusions are broadly applicable to wherever benefit-cost analysis is practiced...Sunstein thinks deeply, writes engagingly, and is often provocative...[<i>The Cost-Benefit Revolution</i>] is likely to lead to much interesting debate as well as to new developments in the field.</p>&#x2015;<b>Lisa A.

For many, the Proverbs are hard to study because the topics jump around from verse to verse. <i>The One Year Wisdom for Women Devotional</i> is a practical tool that will help women in their daily walk with the Lord. It is a great companion to the <i>One Year Bible</i> because it directly follows that book&#x2019;s daily Proverbs reading. Each day not only follows the script of the Wisdom for Women audio program, it also references the <i>One Year Bible</i> reading schedule and ends with a powerful call to action.</p><p></p><h2>Whistler: A Life for Art&#39;s Sake</h2><p><b>A major new biography of James McNeill Whistler, one of most complex, intriguing, and important of America&#x2019;s artists</b><br><br> The first biography in more than twenty years of James McNeill Whistler (1834&#x2013;1903) is also the first to make extensive use of the artist&#x2019;s private correspondence to tell the story of his life and work. This engaging personal history dispels the popular notion of Whistler as merely a combative, eccentric, and unrelenting publicity seeker, a man as renowned for his public feuds with Oscar Wilde and John Ruskin as for the iconic portrait of his mother. The Whistler revealed in these pages is an intense, introspective, and complex man, plagued by self-doubt and haunted by an endless pursuit of perfection in his painting and drawing.<br> &nbsp;<br> In his beautifully illustrated and deeply human portrayal of the artist, Daniel E. Sutherland shows why Whistler was perhaps the most influential artist of his generation, and certainly a pivotal figure in the cultural history of the nineteenth century. Whistler comes alive through his own magnificent work and words, including the provocative manifestos that explained his bold artistic vision, sparked controversy in his own time, and resonate to this day.</p><p>This engaging biography, now in paperback, brings to life a pivotal figure in nineteenth-century cultural history, perhaps the most influential artist of his generation.<b>Daniel E.

Why did some states become absolutist and others constitutionalist? What enabled some to develop bureaucratic administrative systems, while others remained dependent upon patrimonial practices? This book presents a new theory of state-building in medieval and early modern Europe. Ertman argues that two factors--local government and sustained geo-military competition--can explain most of the variation found across the continent.</p><p>This book presents a new theory of state building in medieval and early modern Europe. Ertman argues that two factors--the organization of local government at the time of state formation and the timing of sustained geomilitary competition--can explain most of the variation in political regimes and in state infrastructures found across the continent during the second half of the 18th century."...a stimulating read....Ertman's key insight is that the timing of geopolitical competition matters immensely to political development, an argument which he presents and supports elegantly....The sociologist Ertman possesses a fine sense of history, and historians, whether they end up agreeing with Ertman's assessment or not, will not be disappointed reading this interesting book." Rolf Strom-Olsen, The Sixteenth Century Journal<br><br>"This is an excellent discussion of the development of the state in medieval and early modern Europe. It is innovative theoretically; broadly but selectively comparative among western, central, and eastern Europe and Scandinavia; well grounded in monographic literature in five languages; and well-written....this is a stimulating study, well worth reading by anyone interested in early stages of state development." R.

Its purpose is to show the pervasiveness of prejudice against blacks throughout the western world as expressed in stock-in-trade racist imagery and caricature.

Pieterse shows that blacks have been routinely depicted throughout the West as servants, entertainers, and athletes, and that particular countries have developed their own comforting black stereotypes about blacks: Sambo and Uncle Tom in the United States, Golliwog in Britain, Bamboula in France, and Black Peter in the Netherlands. Looking at conventional portrayals of blacks in the nursery, in sexual arenas, and in commerce and advertising, Pieterse analyzes the conceptual roots of the stereotypes about them. The images that he presents have a direct and dramatic impact, and they raise questions about the expression of power within popular culture and the force of caricature, humor, and parody as instruments of oppression.</p><p>White on Black is a compelling illustrated history of the development of European and American stereotypes of black people over the last two hundred years.

Organized into 16 chapters, the book provides examples to illustrate the use of Semantic Web technologies in solving common modeling problems. It uses the life and works of William Shakespeare to demonstrate some of the most basic capabilities of the Semantic Web. The book first provides an overview of the Semantic Web and aspects of the Web. It then discusses semantic modeling and how it can support the development from chaotic information gathering to one characterized by information sharing, cooperation, and collaboration. It also explains the use of RDF to implement the Semantic Web by allowing information to be distributed over the Web, along with the use of SPARQL to access RDF data. Moreover, the reader is introduced to components that make up a Semantic Web deployment and how they fit together, the concept of inferencing in the Semantic Web, and how RDFS differs from other schema languages. Finally, the book considers the use of SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) to manage vocabularies by taking advantage of the inferencing structure of RDFS-Plus. This book is intended for the working ontologist who is trying to create a domain model on the Semantic Web.<ul><li>Updated with the latest developments and advances in Semantic Web technologies for organizing, querying, and processing information, including SPARQL, RDF and RDFS, OWL 2.0, and SKOS </li><li>Detailed information on the ontologies used in today's key web applications, including ecommerce, social networking, data mining, using government data, and more </li><li>Even more illustrative examples and case studies that demonstrate what semantic technologies are and how they work together to solve real-world problems</li></ul></p><p>Dean Allemang is the chief scientist at TopQuadrant, Inc.-the first company in the United States devoted to consulting, training, and products for the Semantic Web.

Giving just enough philosophical background, the authors focus on the practical aspects of constructing data stores and applications. This blend of philosophy and practical descriptions leads the reader to anticipate how the standards of the semantic Web should work before the standards are described. As a result, the reader is likely to feel that the semantic Web works just as it should." --<b>Computing Reviews</b></p> <p>"Allemang, a scientist at a company that consults, trains, and provides products for the Semantic Web, and Hendler (computer and cognitive science, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute) explain how web developers who are practitioners in another field, such as health care, finance, engineering, national intelligence, and enterprise architecture, can model data to fit the requirements of the Semantic Web. They detail how to construct semantic models, with a focus on the use of RDF (Resource Description Framework), RDFS (RDF schema), and OWL (Web Ontology Language) to accomplish specific tasks and model data and domains. This edition has been updated to incorporate new technologies such as SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol And RDF Query Language), OWL 2.0, and SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System).

For many business problems, excellent solutions already exist. We participated in this development process and learned from experienced people. But knowledge about Cognos has been like a patchwork. Only a few sites and communities exist, and most experience has been gained by intuition and trial and error. Every novice has to go the hard way and build solid knowledge from various more or less trustworthy sources. It often takes years to become an expert. We have felt this ourselves: to train our colleagues in the secrets of Cognos TM1 takes time and effort. </p><p>Our intention is to increase the speed of the diffusion of Cognos TM1 into the business world. For this, of course, marketing is necessary, but good and comprehensive knowledge is more important. So we want to provide everything that is necessary to work with Cognos TM1 effectively, or at least what we think is necessary to work with it. </p><p>The obvious question is: why hasn&#x2019;t there been a book about Cognos TM1 before now? Perhaps Cognos TM1 has been a tool for insiders. You definitely need critical mass for a book project.

Yet very few of the ensuing debates and discussions have managed to provide a full and objective treatment of the subject.<br><br><em>Atheism: What Everyone Needs to Know</em> provides a balanced look at the topic, considering atheism historically, philosophically, theologically, sociologically and psychologically. Written in an easily accessible style, the book uses a question and answer format to examine the history of atheism, arguments for and against atheism, the relationship between religion and science, and the issue of the meaning of life-and whether or not one can be a happy and satisfied atheist. Above all, the author stresses that the atheism controversy is not just a matter of the facts, but a matter of burning moral concern, both about the stand one should take on the issues and the consequences of one's commitment.</p><p><br><strong>Michael Ruse</strong> was born in 1940 in England. Raised in a Quaker family, he went to Bootham School in York and then to the University of Bristol, where he majored in mathematics and philosophy. In 1962 he emigrated to Canada and did graduate work at McMaster University in Ontario. He returned to Bristol to do his doctoral degree in philosophy. He taught at the University of Guelph from 1965 to 2000, and then to avoid compulsory retirement moved south to Florida State University. He is the author or editor of over fifty books, the founding editor of <em>Biology and Philosophy</em>, the recipient of four honorary degrees, a Guggenheim Fellow, a Gifford Lecturer, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. His academic interests are in the history and philosophy of the biological sciences and he is an expert on the work and influence of Charles Darwin. In recent years, his attention has been turned increasingly towards the relationships between science and religion. He is not a believer, but thinks that the two can exist together harmoniously.<br><br>"Fully aware of how tedious tracts on either theology or atheism can be, Michael Ruse sets out not to be boring. He succeeds! As a nonbeliever who hesitates to call himself an atheist, he also strives in this book to be balanced and fair to his opponents.

Nevertheless, the principles underlying these new technologies remain constant. In the tenth edition of this benchmark text, Frank Moffitt and John Bossler strike the appropriate balance between teaching students the fundamental principles of surveying and bringing them up to date on the technological advances that are changing the field. The new edition of this classic work completely modernizes much of the notation, form, and substance of the original. By removing much of the dated information, the authors have been able to add entire new chapters on GPS and GIS. Throughout the text, emphasis is placed on NAD 83 over NAD 27 as the new datum is being utilized more frequently. Professors familiar with previous editions of this textbook will still recognize its clear, yet rigorous explanation of topics. No shortcuts are taken in the presentation of material from the time a concept is introduced through its exploration in worked examples. The book&#39;s tradition of covering both plane and geodetic surveying has been preserved, which makes it the most comprehensive introductory text on surveying on the market.</p><p>Surveying is essentially the science of measurement of the spatial positions of the features on or near the surface of the earth. The practice of surveying is changing rapidly because of the availability of electronically controlled instruments, automatic capture and rapid transfer of field measurements, widespread adoption of the Global Positioning system (GPS), and the proliferation of various geographic Land Information Systems (GIS/LIS). Nevertheless, the principles underlying the new technology remain fairly constant. For example, the basic equations and computing techniques presented in this book are used to develop the computer programs employed by the practicing surveyor. Software is available for practically any situation encountered by the surveyor, including coordinate geometry, traverse calculations, adjustment computations, directions from astronomical observations, road design and layout, earthwork calculations, and stake-out data. The authors have attempted to present the material underlying these forgoing advances in such a way that the student can learn the principles of surveying by self-study. References at the ends of the chapters are intended to expand the knowledge acquired throughout study of the basic principles found in the book. Several major revisions have been made since the previous edition. Moreover, every chapter has been brought up to date and changed , although some only slightly. The information on Inertial Surveying has been dropped completely. Chapter 10 is devoted to GPS, thus separating traditional control surveying from this expanding technology and providing a simple but comprehensive explanation of GPS. Emphasis is placed on the NAD 83 as contrasted with NAD 27, as the redefinitions of the control networks in North America are now complete and the new datum is being utilized at a rapidly growing rate. In Chapter 11 we provide a computer program (TRANSFOR) to compute state plane coordinates. The examples provided with the program are the same as those given in the text. Chapter 20 on Geographic Information Systems has been added, along with a problem set and a compete and an extensive bibliography. Appendix A has been shortened considerably be removing the sections no the adjustment of triangulation. We have worked hard to make this book readable and easy to understand, while at the same time presenting current material that will be valuable to the modern surveyor.

The new edition of the popular Nat Geo Kids Dinopedia includes all the latest species and is the most complete, up-to-date dinosaur reference available. Find favorites, like the fierce T-rex and the gentle Brontosaurus, plus audacious new finds, like the Anzu, Kosmoceratops, and Yi. Every dino profile is colorfully illustrated and features descriptions of when they roamed the Earth, how they lived, what they ate, and more. There are more than 600 dinos featured in all, including 10 profiles of recently discovered dinosaurs and new entries in the Dino Dictionary. Reports from paleontologists present the latest news and insights from the field.</p><p>"DINO" DON LESSEM has written more than 50 books on dinosaurs and other animals for children and adults. He led the construction of the largest dinosaur skeleton, Argentinosaurus, and the largest meat-eating dinosaur, Gigantosaurus. Lessem was adviser on the movie Jurassic Park. He has hosted and written television documentaries. He creates museum exhibitions on dinosaurs and created the two largest charities for dinosaur research.<br><br>Artist FRANCO TEMPESTA specializes in naturalistic illustration with a specialty in realistic illustration of dinosaurs and primitive mammals.

Tempesta is the 2016 recipient of the Lanzendorf PaleoArt Prize for 2-D art from the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology. He has illustrated several books for National Geographic Kids.The subtitle, The Most Complete Dinosaur Reference Ever, sets its sights high, but this impressive, oversize volume lives up to the claim. Lessem has written more than 40 books on dinosaurs, and in the opening chapter here, he presents broad basics on their behavior and habitats as well as a look at major discoveries in paleontology. However, it&#x2019;s the later chapters, which devote two pages each to specific dinosaurs, that will hook hard-core dino lovers. The etymology of each dinosaur name is explained, and each is written phonetically so that readers can share their newly acquired knowledge with perfect pronunciation. Tempesta&#x2019;s full-page illustrations appear on every spread and jump off the page, and the dynamic layout, with fact boxes, captions, and a main text, is immensely appealing. A concluding 40-page &#x201c;Dino-Dictionary&#x201d; keys each dinosaur to its family group and provides additional fodder for dinosaur trivia. Books on this topic are certainly nothing new, but Lessem&#x2019;s comprehensive overview will satisfy the interested browser as much as the ardent dinosaur enthusiast.

It was a time when injustice was met by a lust for vengeance, and rarely was a distinction made between the innocent and the guilty. Against this tumultuous historical backdrop, Dickens' great story of unsurpassed adventure and courage unfolds. Unjustly imprisoned for 18 years in the Bastille, Dr. Alexandre Manette is reunited with his daughter, Lucie, and safely transported from France to England. It would seem that they could take up the threads of their lives in peace. As fate would have it though, the pair are summoned to the Old Bailey to testify against a young Frenchman &#x2014; Charles Darnay &#x2014; falsely accused of treason. Strangely enough, Darnay bears an uncanny resemblance to another man in the courtroom, the dissolute lawyer's clerk Sydney Carton. It is a coincidence that saves Darnay from certain doom more than once. Brilliantly plotted, the novel is rich in drama, romance, and heroics that culminate in a daring prison escape in the shadow of the guillotine. &#x201c;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times&#x201d;, those days in which your English Literature professor ordered you to read &#x201c;A Tale of Two Cities&#x201d; by Charles Dickens. You were immediately confounded by the perplexity of the story and confused by the language of the times. In your despair, you struggled, endeavored and persevered to reach the conclusion of the classic novel. Having satisfactorily completed the requirements of that difficult semester, you vowed to never again read classic English literature. As the years accumulated, you garnered wisdom and spirituality as you aged and you gathered far greater literary acumen. Your mind was transformed and you began to yearn for the great stories that could only be told by the true masters. Anon, you found yourself immersed in the incredible classic writings of Charles Dickens. For no one could so completely transport you to the mean filthy streets of Oliver Twist&#x2019;s London or the horror and dread of The Reign of Terror in that unfortunate tale of London and Paris in the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-three. No other writer could place you so deeply into the mind of a tyrannical boss such as Ebenezer Scrooge or imbue the viciousness of a violent revolutionary the likes of Madame Defarge. Contemporary writers only wish they had the amazing ability to create magnificent unlikely heroes and fantastic characters whose flame of eternal hope burned against an all consuming darkness.</p><p>The classic, definitive, world-famous Nonesuch Press edition of 1937, finally available again and bound in leather and linen. The text in these stunning volumes is taken from the 1867 Chapman and Hall edition, which became known as the Charles Dickens edition and was the last edition to be corrected by the author himself. The Nonesuch edition contains full-color illustrations selected by Dickens himself, by artists including Hablot Knight Browne ("Phiz"), George Cruikshank, John Leech, Robert Seymour, and George Cattermole.<br><br> <i>The Nonesuch Dickens</i> reproduces the original elegance of these beautiful editions. Books are printed on natural cream-shade high quality stock, quarter bound in bonded leather with cloth sides, include a ribbon marker, and feature special printed endpapers. Each volume is wrapped in a protective, clear acetate jacket.<br><br> The books are available as individual volumes, or as sets. The six-volume set contains <i>Oliver Twist, Bleak House, Christmas Books, Nicholas Nickleby, David Copperfield,</i> and <i>Great Expectations</i> together with <i>Hard Times</i>. The three-volume set contains <i>A Tale of Two Cities, Little Dorrit,</i> and <i>The Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit</i>.With his sublime parting words, &#34;It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done...&#34; Sidney Carton joins that exhalted group of Dickensian characters who have earned a permanent place in the popular literary imagination. His dramatic story, set against the volcanic fury of the French Revolution and pervaded by the ominous rumble of the death carts trundling toward the guillotine, is the heart-stirring tale of a heroic soul in an age gone mad. A masterful pageant of idealism, love, and adventure -- in a Paris bursting with revolutionary frenzy, and a London alive with anxious anticipation -- &#34;A Tale of Two Cities is one of Dickens&#39;s most energetic and exciting works.</p><h2>Associated Press Guide to Photojournalism (Associated Press Handbooks)</h2><p>Written by noted AP photographer and photoeditor Brian Horton, this is an insider&#x2019;s manual to one of the most glamorous and exciting media professions.

At the same time, in a nearby attic, the painter Johannes Vermeer was using another optical device, a camera obscura, to experiment with light and create the most luminous pictures ever beheld.</p><p>&#x201c;See for yourself!&#x201d; was the clarion call of the 1600s. Scientists peered at nature through microscopes and telescopes, making the discoveries in astronomy, physics, chemistry, and anatomy that ignited the Scientific Revolution. Artists investigated nature with lenses, mirrors, and camera obscuras, creating extraordinarily detailed paintings of flowers and insects, and scenes filled with realistic effects of light, shadow, and color. By extending the reach of sight the new optical instruments prompted the realization that there is more than meets the eye. But they also raised questions about how we see and what it means to see. In answering these questions, scientists and artists in Delft changed how we perceive the world.</p><p>In <em>Eye of the Beholder</em>, Laura J. Snyder transports us to the streets, inns, and guildhalls of seventeenth-century Holland, where artists and scientists gathered, and to their studios and laboratories, where they mixed paints and prepared canvases, ground and polished lenses, examined and dissected insects and other animals, and invented the modern notion of seeing. With charm and narrative flair Snyder brings Vermeer and Van Leeuwenhoek&#x2015;and the men and women around them&#x2015;vividly to life. The story of these two geniuses and the transformation they engendered shows us why we see the world&#x2015;and our place within it&#x2015;as we do today.</p><p><em>Eye of the Beholder</em> was named "A Best Art Book of the Year" by Christie's and "A Best Read of the Year" by <em>New Scientist&nbsp;</em>in 2015.</p> 16 pages of color illustrations</p><p>Fulbright scholar Laura J.

And certainly what Melville did for whaling Austen does for marriage--tracing the intricacies (not to mention the economics) of 19th-century British mating rituals with a sure hand and an unblinking eye. As usual, Austen trains her sights on a country village and a few families--in this case, the Bennets, the Philips, and the Lucases. Into their midst comes Mr. Bingley, a single man of good fortune, and his friend, Mr. Darcy, who is even richer. Mrs. Bennet, who married above her station, sees their arrival as an opportunity to marry off at least one of her five daughters. Bingley is complaisant and easily charmed by the eldest Bennet girl, Jane; Darcy, however, is harder to please. Put off by Mrs. Bennet's vulgarity and the untoward behavior of the three younger daughters, he is unable to see the true worth of the older girls, Jane and Elizabeth. His excessive pride offends Lizzy, who is more than willing to believe the worst that other people have to say of him; when George Wickham, a soldier stationed in the village, does indeed have a discreditable tale to tell, his words fall on fertile ground. </p><p> Having set up the central misunderstanding of the novel, Austen then brings in her cast of fascinating secondary characters: Mr. Collins, the sycophantic clergyman who aspires to Lizzy's hand but settles for her best friend, Charlotte, instead; Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr. Darcy's insufferably snobbish aunt; and the Gardiners, Jane and Elizabeth's low-born but noble-hearted aunt and uncle. Some of Austen's best comedy comes from mixing and matching these representatives of different classes and economic strata, demonstrating the hypocrisy at the heart of so many social interactions. And though the novel is rife with romantic misunderstandings, rejected proposals, disastrous elopements, and a requisite happy ending for those who deserve one, Austen never gets so carried away with the romance that she loses sight of the hard economic realities of 19th-century matrimonial maneuvering. Good marriages for penniless girls such as the Bennets are hard to come by, and even Lizzy, who comes to sincerely value Mr. Darcy, remarks when asked when she first began to love him: "It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley." She may be joking, but there's more than a little truth to her sentiment, as well. Jane Austen considered Elizabeth Bennet "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print". Readers of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> would be hard-pressed to disagree. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

Delicate as a child, he was taught at home by his mother before he attended grammar school. At sixteen, Hardy was apprenticed to an architect, and for many years, architecture was his profession; in his spare time, he pursued his first and last literary love, poetry. Finally convinced that he could earn his living as an author, he retired from architecture, married, and devoted himself to writing. An extremely productive novelist, Hardy published an important book every year or two. In 1896, disturbed by the public outcry over the unconventional subjects of his two greatest novels&#x2014;<b>Tess of the D&#x2019;Urbervilles</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>Jude the Obscure</b>&#x2014;he announced that he was giving up fiction and afterward produced only poetry. In later years, he received many honors. He was buried in Poet&#x2019;s Corner, in Westminster Abbey. It was as a poet that he wished to be remembered, but today critics regard his novels as his most memorable contribution to English literature for their psychological insight, decisive delineation of character, and profound presentation of tragedy.<p>The boy stood under the rick before mentioned, and every few seconds used his clacker or rattle briskly. At each clack the rooks left off pecking, and rose and went away on their leisurely wings, burnished like tassets of mail, afterwards wheeling back and regarding him warily, and descending to feed at a more respectful distance. </p><p>He sounded the clacker till his arm ached, and at length his heart grew sympathetic to the birds' thwarted desires. They seemed, like himself, to be living in a world that did not want them. Why should he frighten them away? They took upon them more and more the aspect of friends and gentle pensioners - the only friends he could claim as being in the least degree interested in him, for his aunt had often told him that she was not. He ceased his rattling and they alighted anew. </p><p>'Poor little dears!' said Jude, aloud. 'You shall have some dinner - you shall. There is enough for us all. Farmer Troutham can afford to let you have some. Eat, then, my dear little birdies, and make a good meal!' </p><p>They stayed and ate, inky spots on the nut-brown soil, and Jude enjoyed their appetite. A magic thread of fellow-feeling united his own life with theirs. Puny and as sorry as those lives were, they much resembled his own. </p><p>His clacker he had by this time thrown away from him, as being a mean and sordid instrument, offensive both to the birds and to himself as their friend. All at once he became conscious of a smart blow upon his buttocks, followed by a loud clack, which announced to his surprised senses that the clacker had been the instrument of offence used. The birds and Jude started up simultaneously, and the dazed eyes of the latter beheld the farmer in person, the great Troutham himself, his red face glaring down upon Jude's cowering frame, the clacker swinging in his hand. </p><p>'So it's 'Eat, my dear birdies,' is it, young man? 'Eat dear birdies' indeed! I'll tickle your breeches if you say, 'Eat dear birdies' again in a hurry! And you've been idling at the schoolmaster's too, instead of coming here, ha'n't ye hey? That's how you earn your sixpence a day for keeping the rooks off my corn!' </p><p>Whilst saluting Jude's ears with this impassioned rhetoric, Troutham had seized his left hand with his own left, and swinging his slim frame round him at arm's-length, again struck Jude on the hind parts with the flat side of Jude's own rattle, till the field echoed with the blows, which were delivered once or twice at each revolution. </p><p>'Don't 'ee, sir - please don't 'ee!' cried the whirling child, as helpless under the centrifugal tendency of his person as a hooked fish swinging to land, and beholding the hill, the rick, the plantation, the path, and the rooks going round and round him in an amazing circular race. 'I - I - sir - only meant that - there was a good crop in the ground - I saw 'em sow it - and the rooks could have a little bit for dinner - and you wouldn't miss it, sir - and Mr. Phillotson said I was to be kind to 'em - O, O, O!' </p><p>This truthful explanation seemed to exasperate the farmer even more than if Jude had stoutly denied saying anything at all; and he still smacked the whirling urchin, the clacks of the instrument continuing to resound all across the field, and as far as the ears of distant workers - who gathered thereupon that Jude was pursuing his business of clacking with great assiduity - and echoing from the brand-new church tower just behind the mist, towards the building of which structure the farmer had largely subscribed, to testify his love for God and man. </p><p>Presently Troutham grew tired of his punitive task, and depositing the quivering boy on his legs, took a sixpence from his pocket and gave it to him in payment for his day's work, telling him to go home and never let him see him in one of those fields again. </p><p></p>Jude leapt out of arm's reach, and walked along the trackway weeping - not from pain, though that was keen enough; not from the perception of the flaw in the terrestrial scheme, by which was good for God's birds was bad for God's gardener; but with the sense that he had wholly disgraced himself before he had been a year in the parish, and hence might be a burden to his great-aunt for life. <p></p><p>With this shadow on his mind he did not care to show himself in the village, and went homeward by a roundabout track behind a hedge and across a pasture. Here he beheld scores of coupled earthworms lying half their length on the surface of the damp ground, as they always did in such weather at that time of year. It was impossible to advance in regular steps without crushing some of them at each tread. </p><p>Though Farmer Troutham had just hurt him, he was a boy who could not himself bear to hurt anything. He never brought home a nest of young birds without lying awake in misery half the night after, and often reinstating them and the nest in their original place the next morning. He could scarcely bear to see trees cut down or lopped, from a fancy that it hurt them; and late pruning, when the sap was up and the tree bled profusely, had been a positive grief to him in his infancy. This weakness of character, as it may be called, suggested that he was the sort of man who was born to ache a good deal before the fall of the curtain upon his unnecessary life should signify that all was well with him again. He carefully picked his way on tiptoe among the earthworms, without killing a single one.</p><p></p></p><h2>The Devil&#39;s Casino: Friendship, Betrayal, and the High Stakes Games Played Inside Lehman Brothers</h2><p><b>The inside story of what really happened at Lehman Brothers and why it failed</b><p>In The Devil's Casino: Friendship, Betrayal, and the High Stakes Games Played Inside Lehman Brothers, investigative writer and Vanity Fair contributing editor Vicky Ward takes readers inside Lehman's highly charged offices. What Ward uncovers is a much bigger story than Lehman losing at the risky game of collateralized debt obligations, swaps, and leverage.</p><p>A can't put it down page turner that opens the world of Wall Street to view unlike any book since Bonfire of the Vanities, except that The Devil's Casino isn't fiction.</p><ul><li>Details what went on behind-the-scenes the weekend Lehman Brothers failed, as well as inside Lehman during the twenty years preceding it</li><li>Describes the feudal culture that proved both Lehman's strength and its Achilles' heel</li><li>Written by Vicky Ward, one of today's most connected business and finance writers</li></ul><p>On Wall Street, Lehman Brothers was cheekily known as "the cat with nine lives." But as The Devil's Casino documents, this cat pushed its luck too far and died?the victim of men and women blinded by arrogance.</p></p><p>They were the Rat Pack of Wall Street. Four close friends: one a decorated war hero, one an emotional hippie, and two regular guys with big hearts, big dreams, and noble aims. They were going to get rich on Wall Street. They were going to prove that men like them ? with zero financial training - could more than equal the Ivy-League-educated white shoe bankers who were the competition. They were going to create an institution for men like them -- men who were hungry and untrained ? and they were going to win, but not at the cost of their souls. <p> In short, they were going to be the good guys of finance. </p><p> Under their watch, Lehman Brothers started to grow and became independent again in 1994. But something had gone wrong on the journey. The men slowly, perhaps inevitably, changed. As Lehman Brothers grew, so too did the cracks in and among the men who had rebuilt it. </p><p> Ward takes you inside Lehman's highly charged offices. You'll meet beloved leaders who were erased from the corporate history books, but who could have taken the firm in a very different direction had they not fallen victim to infighting and their own weaknesses. You will encounter an unlikely and almost unknown Marcus Brutus, who may have had more to do with Lehman?s failings than anyone?including Dick Fuld, who has widely been considered the poster-child for the mistakes and greed of all bankers. </p><p> What Ward uncovers is that Lehman may have lost at the risky games of collateralized debt obligations, swaps, and leverage but that was just the end of a bigger story. "Little Lehman" was the Wall Street shop known to be forever fighting for its life and somehow succeeding. On Wall Street it was cheekily known as "the cat with nine lives." But this cat pushed its luck too far -- and died, the victim of men and women blinded by arrogance. Come inside <i>The Devil's Casino</i> and see how good men lose their way, and see how a firm that rose with the glory and bravado of Icarus fell burning in flames not so much from a sun, but from a match lit from within. </p> <p> <b>Amazon Exclusive: Q&amp;A with Author Vicky Ward</b><br> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p></p> <b><i>The Devil&#x2019;s Casino</i> traces the history of the players and the company in a way that makes the fall of Lehman seem inevitable. Would you agree with that statement and why or why not?</b> <br> Yes I would. I don&#x2019;t think that the way Lehman was run was sustainable in the long-term. You cannot run a major securities firm without tolerating dissent or change at the top. Lehman&#x2019;s &#x201c;one firm&#x201d; culture that made it so great when it was a tiny sub-division of a much larger entity became its nemesis when it was a stand-alone investment bank. Anyone who disagreed with Dick Fuld, or more importantly, the firm&#x2019;s day-to-day manager Joe Gregory was either fired or quit. That is not the way Goldman Sachs is run, nor JP Morgan Chase. In those houses the CEOs seek out all sorts of different views in their senior executives. At Lehman anyone who argued about risk management was shoved aside. Eventually that position is not tenable. <p></p> <b>Discuss some of the people you were able to talk to throughout the writing process. Do you have a favorite interview or experience during the process?</b> <br> Well, I loved talking to Peter A. Cohen because he&#x2019;s famous (to readers of <i>Barbarians at the Gate</i>) as being one of the most terrifying cigar-chomping bankers on The Street but I found him rather charming. He still carries his cigar. He just doesn&#x2019;t smoke it anymore! <p></p> I also really enjoyed meeting Bob Steel, the former Treasury Undersecretary. I found him to be a very thoughtful judge of character who had a very large perspective not just on Wall Street but on the world. Hank Paulson too was really terrific. Very blunt, and actually very, very funny! When he told me that he used to tell Goldman Sachs bankers &#x201c;listen, everyone hates you except your mother &#x2013; and if you are lucky &#x2013; your wife&#x201d; it was hilarious! He was making the point that bankers become their own worst enemies if they are ostentatious &#x2013; which he most certainly is not. <p></p> Some of the best interviews were off the record so I cannot say who they were with but I talked to some people so often that I felt my life would be dramatically different once the book was over: it would be very odd not to talk to them all the time. <p></p> I also did love Karin and Bradley Jack. Karin Jack has got to have the funniest sense of humor in a Wall Street wife I&#x2019;ve ever heard &#x2013; and I loved the fact that her ex-husband actually backed up everything she said (which was essentially how grim it was to be a Lehman wife!). They were a terrific pair. <p></p> And then there were just some fabulous people who really saw things straight and put me straight. John Cecil, Lehman&#x2019;s former CFO, was painstakingly patient with me. I really owe him. And Tom Hill, the vice-chairman of Blackstone was a man I came to greatly admire. Even though Dick Fuld had shafted him back in 1993, he had a lot of sympathy for the Lehman people and I think really felt the tragedy of the firm&#x2019;s collapse. <p></p> <b>Share with us one of your key takeaways from your experience writing <i>The Devil&#x2019;s Casino</i>.</b> <br> Weirdly, that not all bankers are bad and that there are many shades of grey on Wall Street; it isn&#x2019;t black and white. I think there was a lot of good and bravery in some of the protagonists of the book, and not all of them chose to take the Machiavellian path to ultimate power and riches, no matter what the risk or cost. Tom Tucker is an unsung hero: the former head of sales, who grew horrified at what they&#x2019;d all turned into and gave back his bonus and set up a non-profit foundation for underprivileged children. Dick Fuld, too, actually was a very moral man, whose mistakes, I think were more unintentional, than intentional for the most part. This doesn&#x2019;t excuse him. It just makes the story more interesting. <p></p> <b>What are the implications for the future, post-Lehman and post-crash?</b> <br> Well, to be honest, not good. I think the book is really a kind of morality-tale. It shows us how the best intentions go astray and how the will to acquire, to succeed, is in the end a force of human nature and is rarely tempered and overcome. I think the book shows that no matter what the &#x201c;rules&#x201d; or &#x201c;regulations&#x201d; are on the Street, clever or hungry bankers have always historically found a way around them. So I think that we will see history repeated &#x2013; probably not tomorrow. But eventually &#x2013; yes. Doesn&#x2019;t history always get repeated? Isn&#x2019;t that the irony of humanity? <p></p>"Lehman Brothers, the oldest partnership on Wall Street, was alwaysa brilliant but cursed child. Its life, and death, tells us why itwas a magnet for talent, and why it was toxic. There have been aslew of terrific books on how Wall Street brought the economy toits knees, but in <i>The Devil's Casino</i>, Vicky Ward doessomething unusual. She takes the reader inside. Not just inside thefinancial instruments, but inside the culture that sired them;inside the families, including the spouses and children thatenjoyed lavish riches; and inside the internal rivalries andmismanagement that speeded the fall. Readers of this remarkabletale do not stand outside looking in, their noses pressed to theglass; we are inside looking out. We feel the seething greed andjealousies&#x2014;the stuff that makes novels come alive. In theend, the child dies. But because of the way Vicky Ward unspools thesaga of Lehman, its life and death will both instruct and foreversear your memory."<br>&#x2014;<b>KEN AULETTA</b>, author of <i>Googled: The End of theWorld as We Know It</i> and <i>Greed and Glory on Wall Street: TheFall of the House of Lehman</i> <p>"<i>The Devil's Casino</i> tells the riveting story of the fourbest friends who rebuilt Lehman Brothers, vowing to be 'the goodguys of Wall Street,' only to find themselves corrupted by thepoisonous culture there. With its illicit affairs, treachery,s�ances, boardroom backstabbing, and friendships and familiestorn apart, the book reads like a page-turning thriller. Who wouldguess that the story of life at Lehman would turn out to be evenmore dramatic than the firm's headline-grabbing, economy-shakingdemise."<br>&#x2014;<b>ARIANNA HUFFINGTON</b>, cofounder and Editor in Chief of<i>The Huffington Post</i></p><p>"<i>The Devil's Casino</i> is the totally compelling true story,deeply researched but as exciting as a thriller&#x2014;the almostmythical saga of four friends destroyed by money, sex, andambition, with a cast of greedy larger-than-life Wall Streetmonsters, and an intimate history of the fall of Lehman. Asexciting and important as Barbarians at the Gate, it's a grippingportrait of American society and financial culture that explainsmuch of what is happening today. I can already see themovie."<br>&#x2014;<b>SIMON SEBAG MONTEFIORE</b>, author of <i>Stalin: TheCourt of the Red Tsar</i></p><p>"<i>The Devil's Casino</i> is more than a history of LehmanBrothers; it is a saga of four friends who were prepared tosacrifice everything&#x2014;including each other&#x2014;in the questfor money and power.

Thus Robinson, literary editor of the (London) Times Higher Education Supplement, introduces his scholarly and fascinating study of alphabets, hieroglyphics and pictograms. He says he is not presenting the full history of writing, focusing instead on "an account of the scripts used in the major civilizations of the ancient world, of the major scripts we use today, and of the underlying principles that unite the two." But a great deal of the history is here, together with more than 350 splendidly helpful (and viewable) illustrations: cuneiform, Egyptian hieroglyphs, Mayan glyphs, Chinese and Japanese writing, and scripts based on alphabets. <p> Robinson is also interested in the current movement toward increased communication through logograms, or pictographic symbols. Could they be expanded into a universal writing system that would transcend language differences? Robinson thinks not, asserting that whereas logograms can be helpful, "full writing is based on speech." The book is a paperback edition of a hardback published in 1995.</p></p><h2>The Natural World of the California Indians (Volume 46) (California Natural History Guides)</h2><p>This information-packed guide describes patterns of village life, and covers such subjects as Indian tools and artifacts, hunting techniques, and food.</p><p>&#39;{This Volume} offers an excellent introduction to the diversity of native cultures that once flourished in California and emphasizes the integration of those cultures with the various regional environments of the state.</p><h2>Her Majesty</h2><p><p>Born in 1926, married in 1947, crowned as Queen in 1953, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II has carried out her duty for more than six decades.

Born in 1809 to an upper-middle-class medical family, he was destined for a career in either medicine or the Anglican Church. However, he never completed his medical education and his future changed entirely in 1831 when he joined HMS Beagle as a self-financing, independent naturalist. On returning to England in 1836 he began to write up his theories and observations which culminated in a series of books, most famously On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection in 1859, where he challenged and contradicted contemporary biological and religious beliefs with two decades worth of scientific investigation and theory. Darwin&#39;s theory of natural selection is now the most widely accepted scientific model of how species evolve.

He is celebrated for devising the ground-breaking and highly influential working memory model with Graham Hitch in the early 1970s, a model which still proves valuable today in recognising the functions of short-term memory. He was awarded a CBE for his contributions to the study of memory, is a Fellow of the Royal Society, of the British Academy and of the Academy of Medical Sciences. In 2012 he was the recipient of the BPS Research Board's Lifetime Achievement Award recognising his outstanding record of personal achievements and significant contributions to the advancement of psychological knowledge.</p> <p><strong>Michael W. Eysenck</strong> is a Professorial Fellow at Roehampton University. He is also Emeritus Professor and Honorary Fellow at Royal Holloway University of London.&nbsp;Within his research he has focused on various topics within memory research (e.g., levels of processing; distinctiveness). However, for many years his research has focused mainly on anxiety and cognition (including memory). He is the best-selling author of a number of textbooks including Cognitive Psychology: A Student's Handbook, 6th Edition (with Mark T.

It is an outstanding coverage of current findings and theories written by top international authors. This edition has more on the brain correlates of memory, and more on lifespan development and memory disorders.

The text seamlessly integrates research from cognitive psychology, neuropsychology, and neuroimaging. I highly recommend this informative and enjoyable text."</strong> &#x2015;<em>&nbsp;Daniel L. Schacter, Harvard University, USA</em></p> <p><strong>"</strong><strong>The past decade has seen breathtaking leaps in our scientific understanding of human memory, in terms of both behavior and the brain. This text reflects a seamless coordination of effort from three leading memory researchers with complementary interests in different aspects of memory. They manage to present what is known in a thorough, organized, and engaging manner while still conveying the sense of adventure and open-mindedness one needs to appreciate important, unanswered questions about memory that are fundamental to our understanding of what it is to be human." &#x2015; </strong><em>Nelson Cowan, University of Missouri-Columbia, USA</em></p> <p><strong>"I very much liked the first edition of this text. The second edition is even better.

Bravo!"</strong> &#x2015; <em>Henry L. Roediger, III, Washington University in St. Louis, USA</em></p> <p><strong>"The first edition of this book was already the best introduction to the topic available. This second, updated and reorganized edition adds an accessible introduction to techniques for exploring memory functions in the brain, and retains the impressive breadth and depth of coverage from the first edition, written by scientists who have made major contributions themselves to our understanding of human memory." </strong>&#x2015; <em>Robert Logie, University of Edinburgh, UK</em></p> <p><strong>Praise for the first edition:</strong></p> <p><strong>"I do not know of any memory textbook that covers as many aspects of the topic in such a comprehensive and interesting way for a very broad&nbsp;audience."&nbsp;&#x2015;</strong> <em>Lars-Goran Nilsson, Stockholm University and Stockholm Brain Institute, Sweden</em></p> <p><strong>"What distinguishes this delightful and informative book from other textbooks is its eclecticism: it places equal emphasis on data and theory, on typical people and clinical populations, on laboratory experiments and real-world applications, and on methodologies and approaches from experimental psychology and cognitive neuroscience. Best of all, the authors have a historical sensibility while being very up-to-date, which gives the reader a good sense of how the field of memory research developed and where it is heading. I recommend the book enthusiastically."&nbsp;&#x2015;</strong> <em>Morris Moscovitch, Professor of Psychology, University of Toronto and Rotman Research Institute, Baycrest Centre for Geriatric Care, Canada</em></p> <p><strong><em>"</em>The style is accessible, with anecdotes and notable case histories much in evidence, and new paradigms often introduced by an example for the reader to try out. The three authors write clearly, and important terminology is glossed.

Driven mad by constant press attention in the wake of the publication of On the Road, he needed to &#39;get away to solitude again or die&#39;, so he withdrew to a cabin in Big Sur on the Californian coast. The resulting novel, in which his autobiographical hero Jack Duluoz wrestles with doubt, alcohol dependency and his urge towards self-destruction, is one of Kerouac&#39;s most personal and searingly honest works. Ending with the poem &#39;Sea: Sounds of the Pacific Ocean at Big Sur&#39;, it shows a man coming down from his hedonistic youth and trying to come to terms with fame, the world and himself.</p><p>Jack Kerouac (1922-69) was an American novelist, poet, artist and part of the Beat Generation. Most of his life was spent in the vast landscapes of America or living with his mother. Kerouac&#39;s best known works are On the Road and The Dharma Bums.This autobiographical novel continues the adventures of the (older but certainly not mellower) wandering beatnik from ON THE ROAD. For a narrator it contains extraordinary difficulties, for the writing flies off into inebriated, overly long sentences that reflect, describe or just babble forward in a kind of free association. To keep such passages flowing while making sense out of them is no mean feat. Tom Parker pulls it off, erring only infrequently in his interpretation. He even manages to sound as if he were enjoying himself. The production is clean but tinny, possibly dampening the pleasure of home listeners, but hardly bothering drivers listening over traffic noise. Y.R.

Poetic rhythm builds on this knowledge and experience, taking the reader from the most basic questions about the rhythms of spoken English to the elaborate achievements of past and present poets. Terminology is straightforward, the simple system of scansion that is introduced is suitable for both handwriting and computer use, and there are frequent practical exercises. Chapters deal with the elements of verse, English speech rhythms, the major types of metrical poetry, free verse, and the role of sense and syntax. Poetic rhythm will help readers of poetry experience and enjoy its rhythms in all their power, subtlety, and diversity, and will serve as an invaluable tool for those who wish to write or discuss poetry in English at a basic as well as a more advanced level.</p><h2>Java: How to Program, 8th Edition</h2><p>"The [arrays] exercises are quite sophisticated and interesting.

Justly celebrated for its authoritative scholarship and invaluable commentary, Arden guides you a richer understanding and appreciation of Shakespeare&#39;s plays. This edition of Twelfth Night provides, a clear and authoritative text, detailed notes and commentary on the same page as the text, a full introduction discussing the critical and historical background to the play and appendices presenting sources and relevant extracts.</p><p>Twelfth Night has seldom been off the stage since Shakespeare&#39;s day. It has been performed for its romantic high comedy and its boisterous low comedy; with an emphasis on farce or on autumnal melancholy; as straightforward celebration of heterosexual love and marriage or as exploration of the complexity of gender. David Carnegie and Mark Houlahan&#39;s introduction to the play provides a lively discussion of the play&#39;s performance history, and encourages readers to think about stagecraft and the play as a performance text, while the historical appendices provide materials that illuminate different thematic elements of the play. Extended notes interleaved throughout the play present relevant illustrations and expand on mythological, historical, and religious references in the play. The accompanying online text will offer additional commentary on staging alternatives and more extensive visual materials.David Carnegie is Emeritus Professor of Theatre at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand.

We have to keep reminding ourselves that they were not drawn in New York, London, and Paris of the twenty-first century but in the sensation-hungry, inflation-fed milieu of the Weimar Republic.<br>"On an Expense Account," for example, shows a well-fed businessman and his wife. We see only his back and neck, note her tastelessly modish skirts, and we know the whole story. "Total Devotion from 5:00 to 7:00" is a cocktail-bar scene, and in the dancing of the slick-haired man and the posture of his partner there is something depraved because it is only sensual. "Lunch" depicts a matron with unmistakably porcine features holding knife and fork affectedly as she swills. Her dining partner needs no animalization; the blas� bag below his eye, the expression, and the fold below his chin are enough.<br>Can prostitutes, contrary to sentimental folklore, appear smug, bloated with satisfaction, and wallowing in cheap gratification? See "Transit Trade" to realize the effects of mindless materialism. Schiller wrote, "Swim if you can and if you are too weak, sink." Grosz takes this as his text for a compelling contrast between rich and poor in just two figures that completely refute the <i>�bermensch</i> doctrine. Hemingway in <i>Nada</i> did not depict more tellingly the utter despair of empty lives in the hour when the caf� closes than does Grosz in "They Don't Sing Any More." <i>Love Above All?</i> We are only partway through this portfolio when we realize suddenly how bitterly sarcastic is the title.<br>But the mordant eye, angry wit, and social consciences of Grosz were shared by many of his period. What lifts his art above the transient event is his supremely eloquent use of pen and brush. No one has more expressively, piercingly, and economically, drawn the scenes of his special civilization&#x2014;so strangely like ours &#x2014; than did George Grosz.<br></p></p><p>Text: English, German</p><h2>Nutritional Assessment</h2><p>This text describes the four major methods of nutritional assessment (dietary, anthropometric, biometric, and clinical) in an understandable and contemporary way.

Admirers of his work note its serenity, its harmony. In 1979, when Barragan was presented the Pritzker Prize, his work was referred to as "a sublime act of the poetic imagination." It is this aspect of Barragan's work that is presented in The Life and Work of Luis Barragan, a biographical portrait that reveals Barragan as a master of what he himself called "emotional architecture."<br><br>Barragan's impressions and influences are recorded here, from his early years in Gudalajara to his work in Mexico City, and his highly inspiring travels in the Alhambra, the villages of Greece, and northern Africa. His rejection of the concepts of Le Corbusier and the International Style, and his embrace of the ideas of the French intellectual, painter, and landscape architect Ferdinand Bac provided valuable framework for understanding both the theory and form of Barragan's oeuvre.<br><br>Brilliant color photographs record Barragan's vibrant work as it has never been seen before, including generous interior shots of such varied projects as Casa Cristo in Guadalajara, and Casas Galvez, Egerstrom, and Meyer, all from his Mexico City years. Barragan was perhaps first and foremost a landscape architect, and this book spotlights his gardens, and his vanguard, landscape-based approach to architecture itself-centered on the close relationship between landscape, color, and architecture in Mexico and the other lands that inspired him.<br><br>Text and photographs combine in The Life and Work of Luis Barragan for a personal and evocative portrayal of the Mexican master that will fascinate everyone familiar with his legacy, and intrigue those who are only just discovering the power and influence of his work. <br></p><p>Architects <b>Jose M Buendia Julbez </b>and <b>Juan Palomar </b>teach architecture at UAM Xochimilco in Mexico City and ITESCO in Guadalajara, respectively. <b>Guillermo Eguiarte </b>was architect for the Universidad Iberoamericana in 1983 and contributes articles to many major periodicals.<br><br><b>Sebastian Saldivar </b>is one of the most prominent photographers of architecture and interiors in Mexico, and his work has been published in numerous international shelter magazines.<br>Text: English<br> Original Language: Spanish</p><h2>The Rise and Fall of the Spanish Empire</h2><p>A concise history of the rise, organization and fall of the Spanish Empire.</p><p>WILLIAM S.

In this eminently readable primer on the fundamentals of placing stone, Kevin Gardner distills 25 years of experience in building and repairing New England-style dry stone walls into principles and practices that are adaptable to a wide variety of designs and circumstances. In addition to directions on building basic stone walls, he also demystifies steps, wells, ramps, walkways, and may other forms of dry masonry. Gardner also discusses the philosophy behind the repair and restoration of old walls, and gives the beginning wall builder ways to think about the place of the stone wall within the landscape. Along the way, Gardner considers the mythology of the stone wall and its place in the New England imagination. And he explores the history, philosophy, and aesthetics of working with stone in a book that will bring as much pleasure to armchair craftsmen as it will valuable instruction to the beginning wall builder.

The author&#39;s innovative use of nonlinear plot, stream- of-consciousness, and varying narrators, transforms the apparently &#39;normal&#39; incidents in the life of the Ramsay family into a mythic reflection on time, gender, morality, and death. Woolf considered &#39;To the Lighthouse&#39; to be &#34;easily the best of my books&#34;, a judgment with which serious students of literature can only concur.</p><p>From the seemingly trivial postponement of a visit to a nearby lighthouse, Virginia Woolf constructs a remarkable and moving examination of the complex tensions and allegiances of family life, and the conflict between male and female principles, in what is probably her most popular novel.Though its fame as an icon of twentieth-century literature rests primarily on the brilliance of its narrative technique and the impressionistic beauty of its prose, &#39;To The Lighthouse&#39; is above all the story of a quest, and as such it possesses a brave and magical universality.</p><h2>Glimpses of Other Realities: Facts and Eyewitnesses (Volume I)</h2><p>Glimpses Vol. I grew out of Linda's investigations of worldwide crop circle, animal mutilation, and human abduction mysteries through hard physical evidence and firsthand eyewitness testimony with over 300 color and B&amp;W photographs, drawings, maps and documents.</p><p></p><h2>Plato&#39;s Cosmology: The Timaeus of Plato</h2><p><p>A reprint of the Routledge edition of 1935.</p></p><p><p>. . . one of the masterpieces of classical scholarship. . . .

This ancient Puebloan heartland was instrumental in tying together Chaco and Mesa Verde cultures to create a distinctive blend of old and new, local and nonlocal. The contributors to this book attribute the development of Salmon and Aztec to migration and colonization by people from Chaco Canyon. Rather than fighting for control over the territory, Chaco migrants and local leaders worked together to build the great houses of Aztec and Salmon while maintaining their identities and connections with their individual homelands. As a result of this collaboration, the Middle San Juan can be seen as one of the ancient Puebloan heartlands that made important contributions to contemporary Puebloan society.</p></p><p><strong>Paul F.

Crowds stare upwards to decipher the message while the plane turns and loops, leaving off one letter, picking up another. Like the airplane's swooping path, Virginia Woolf's <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> follows Clarissa and those whose lives brush hers--from Peter Walsh, whom she spurned years ago, to her daughter Elizabeth, the girl's angry teacher, Doris Kilman, and war-shocked Septimus Warren Smith, who is sinking into madness.<p> As Mrs. Dalloway prepares for the party she is giving that evening, a series of events intrudes on her composure. Her husband is invited, without her, to lunch with Lady Bruton (who, Clarissa notes anxiously, gives the most amusing luncheons). Meanwhile, Peter Walsh appears, recently from India, to criticize and confide in her. His sudden arrival evokes memories of a distant past, the choices she made then, and her wistful friendship with Sally Seton.</p><p> Woolf then explores the relationships between women and men, and between women, as Clarissa muses, "It was something central which permeated; something warm which broke up surfaces and rippled the cold contact of man and woman, or of women together.... Her relation in the old days with Sally Seton. Had not that, after all, been love?" While Clarissa is transported to past afternoons with Sally, and as she sits mending her green dress, Warren Smith catapults desperately into his delusions. Although his troubles form a tangent to Clarissa's web, they undeniably touch it, and the strands connecting all these characters draw tighter as evening deepens. As she immerses us in each inner life, Virginia Woolf offers exquisite, painful images of the past bleeding into the present, of desire overwhelmed by society's demands. <i>--Joannie Kervran Stangeland</i></p>This edition of Mrs. Dalloway includes substantial explanatory notes compiling past scholarship while identifying new allusions, and a list of textual variants among all editions in Woolf&#39;s lifetime. It also features a composition history, documenting how Woolf&#39;s reading, friendships, and culture contributed to the book, and Woolf&#39;s seldom-reprinted 1928 introduction.</p><h2>The Woggle-Bug Book: Illustrated</h2><p>The Illustrated copy of The Woggle-Bug Book. <br> The Woggle-Bug Book is a 1905 children's book, written by L. Frank Baum, creator of the Land of Oz, and illustrated by Ike Morgan. It has long been one of the rarest items in the Baum bibliography. Baum's text has been controversial for its use of ethnic humor stereotypes. <br> The book grew out of another promotional project, Queer Visitors from the Marvelous Land of Oz (1904-5), a popular comic strip that promoted Baum's second Oz book, The Marvelous Land of Oz (1904). The comic strip, written by Baum and illustrated by Walt McDougall, brought Oz characters including the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and others to the United States for various humorous adventures. The Woggle-Bug Book employs the same concept: H. M. Woggle-Bug, T. E. is shown maladjusted to life in an unnamed American city. The book's artist, Ike Morgan, was a Chicago cartoonist who had earlier provided illustrations for Baum's American Fairy Tales (1901). <br> Odin&#x2019;s Library Classics is dedicated to bringing the world the best of humankind&#x2019;s literature from throughout the ages.

Wind discusses the atmosphere, clouds, different kinds of precipitation, rainbows and mirages, weather systems and storms, climates, and forecasting the weather. None of the books goes into great depth, but all have small, useful tidbits of information scattered throughout.

Founded in 1991 by photographer Oliviero Toscani and art director Tibor Kalman, each issue of <i>Colors</i> focuses on a single topic and follows it around the world, relying on images as heavily as text to tell stories. Some have called it the magazine of the MTV generation; Kalman himself described it as "a mix of <i>National Geographic</i> and <i>Life</i> on acid." <br>In keeping with the structure of its unruly subject, the book treatment of <i>Colors</i> approaches its subject transversely, organizing content thematically to highlight the "Tumblr ante litteram" nature of the publication. Material is grouped under headings such as "That's Amore" (on physical and emotional love of all kinds), "Bang!" (on weapons, violence, lust and shock), "Elvis" (on fame, excess, degeneration, disguise and kitsch) and "I Want to Believe" (on faith, cult, and what we worship now). <br>An attempt to tell the story of <i>Colors</i> in its own words--and make work carried out in the past speak to the present day--this volume recombines text and images from different issues, pulled from the entire 25-year history of the magazine. With a foreword by Francesco Bonami, this volume is a fitting representation of the antic and intelligent spirit that defines the magazine.</p><p>An exceptional book...

Born in Massachusetts in 1745, Bancroft moved to England as a young man in the 1760s and began building a respectable r�sum� as both a scientist and a man of letters. In recognition of his works in natural history, Bancroft was unanimously elected to the Royal Society, and while working to secure French aid for the American Revolution, he became a close associate of such luminaries as Benjamin Franklin, Silas Deane, and John Adams. Though lauded in his time as a staunch American patriot, when the British diplomatic archives were opened in the late nineteenth century, it was revealed that Bancroft led a secret life as a British agent acting against French and American interests.</p><p>In this book, the first complete biography of Bancroft, historian Thomas J. Schaeper reveals the full extent of the agent's deception during the crucial years of the American Revolution. Operating under aliases, working in ciphers, and leaving coded messages in the trees of Paris's Tuileries Gardens, Bancroft filtered information from unsuspecting figures including Franklin and Deane back to his contacts in Britain, navigating a complicated web of political allegiances. Through Schaeper's keen analysis of Bancroft's correspondence and diplomatic records, this biography reveals whether Bancroft should ultimately be considered a traitor to America or a patriot to Britain.</p></p><p><b>Thomas J.

Town residents blamed what they called "Lithobolia" or "the stone-throwing devil." In this lively account, Emerson Baker shows how witchcraft hysteria overtook one town and spawned copycat incidents elsewhere in New England, prefiguring the horrors of Salem. In the process, he illuminates a cross-section of colonial society and overturns many popular assumptions about witchcraft in the seventeenth century.</p></p><p><p><b>Emerson W.

In learning about life on Great Island, at the mouth of the Piscataqua River, readers also learn much about a part of New England that does not fit our standard Puritan stereotypes and thus about a diverse aspect of our collective past that will now become better known.&#x201d; &#x2015;Mary Beth Norton, author of In the Devil's Snare: The Salem Witchcraft Crisis of 1692</p><p>&#x201c;The witch trials of seventeenth-century New England have been extensively worked over by historians, and yet, as this fascinating book shows, there are new insights to be gained by moving the focus beyond Massachusetts and the Puritans.

Here we encounter the contrasting beliefs of Quakers, Puritans, Baptists, Antinomians, and Godless fishermen as well as the clashing political interests of Native Americans, Europeans, Puritans, and Royalists. This masterful narrative of religious and social pluralism in early New England helps to refocus our vision of the foundations of America and also puts other New England witchcraft events into useful perspective.&#x201d; &#x2015;Benjamin C.

Many of the mansions are no longer standing, making this book a critical archive and monument to their glory. In their heyday, they were inhabited by the aristocracy of America's gilded age, among them Vanderbilts, Phipps, and Pratts. The author's evocative photographs capture the splendor of these once luxurious homes, from the houses' turrets, porticos, columns, and courtyards to their vaulted entry halls, spacious ballrooms, and vast libraries.

In this memoir he recounts his entry into comedy and the course of his career, describes the origins of some of his most famous sketches, and reminisces about other comedians he&#39;s worked with (including Carl Reiner, Mel Brooks, and Woody Allen). Annotation (c) Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p>Sid Caesar was born in Yonkers, New York, in 1922 and began his career in comedy while a musician in the Catskills. He was a film and stage star by his mid-twenties, and in 1950 came the debut of <i>Your Show of Shows</i>, followed later in the decade by <i>Caesar's Hour</i>. Caesar has also starred in numerous Broadway shows and Hollywood movies. He lives in Beverly Hills, California. Eddy Friedfeld is an entertainment journalist and film critic. He lives in New York City.In the 1950s, Caesar was to comedy what Marlon Brando was to drama. Gifted in dialects, double-talk, linguistic logistics, mime, music, monologues and satirical sketches, all executed with razor-sharp timing, Caesar created "comedy based on truth" and received acclaim as a comic genius. His fade-out from the tube by the end of that decade left many wondering where he went. Caesar answered that question in his autobiography, Where Have I Been? (1982). Now, collaborating with film critic Friedfeld, he offers a satisfying salmagundi of memoir mixed with a probe into the mechanics of merriment. He opens with memories of saxophone lessons during his Yonkers, N.Y., childhood, followed by comedy in the Catskills. After studying at Juilliard, he played in several orchestras, and his WWII Coast Guard shows led to Hollywood, Broadway and TV's Admiral Broadway Revue (1949). On his legendary Your Show of Shows (1950-1954) and Caesar's Hour (1954-1957), he worked with the era's top comedy writers (Woody Allen, Mel Brooks, Carl Reiner, Neil Simon), and one chapter echoes the chortles and chaos of the famed Writers' Room (later recreated in films by Brooks, Reiner and Simon): "The energy in the Writers' Room was like a cyclotron.... No one ever finished a sentence that I can remember." Detailing many of his classic routines (some with script excerpts), Caesar's prose is appealing, informal and fun to read. Chapters like "The Art of Sketch Comedy" make this required reading for directors, writers and performers.

Thoreau traveled to the backwoods of Maine in 1846, 1853, and 1857. Originally published in 1864, and published now with a new introduction by Paul Theroux, this volume is a powerful telling of those journeys through a rugged and largely unspoiled land. It presents Thoreau's fullest account of the wilderness.</p><br><br><p> <i>The Maine Woods</i> is classic Thoreau: a personal story of exterior and interior discoveries in a natural setting--all conveyed in taut, masterly prose. Thoreau's evocative renderings of the life of the primitive forest--its mountains, waterways, fauna, flora, and inhabitants--are timeless and valuable on their own. But his impassioned protest against the despoilment of nature in the name of commerce and sport, which even by the 1850s threatened to deprive Americans of the "tonic of wildness," makes <i>The Maine Woods</i> an especially vital book for our own time.</p></p><p>Posthumously published in 1864, <i>The Maine Woods</i> depicts Henry David Thoreau&#x2019;s experiences in the forests of Maine, and expands on the author&#x2019;s transcendental theories on the relation of humanity to Nature. On Mount Katahdin, he faces a primal, untamed Nature. Katahdin is a place &#x201c;not even scarred by man, but it was a specimen of what God saw fit to make this world.&#x201d; In Maine he comes in contact with &#x201c;rocks, trees, wind and solid earth&#x201d; as though he were witness to the creation itself. Of equal importance, <i>The Maine Woods</i> depicts Thoreau&#x2019;s contact with the American Indians and depicts his tribal education of learning the language, customs, and mores of the Penobscot people. Thoreau attempts to learn and speak the Abenaki language and becomes fascinated with its direct translation of natural phenomena as in the word <i>sebamook</i>&#x2014;a river estuary&nbsp;that never loses is water despite having an outlet because it also has an inlet. <i> The Maine Woods</i> illustrates the author&#x2019;s deeper understanding of the complexities of the primal wilderness of uplifted rocky summits in Maine and provides the reader with the pungent aroma of balsam firs, black spruce, mosses, and ferns as only Thoreau could. This new, redesigned edition features an insightful foreword by Thoreau scholar Richard Francis Fleck.The Maine Woods is a characteristically Thoreauvian book: a personal account of exploration, of exterior and interior discovery in a natural setting, conveyed on taut, workmanlike prose.</p><h2>Demons (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels)</h2><p>A pair of self-styled revolutionaries and their followers plot to overthrow the Tsar and seize control of the government in Dostoyevsky's compelling tale of ideology and murder in 19th-century Russia. Based on a real-life political assassination, the story unfolds in a fictional town in which Stavrogin, a power-hungry cynic, and Pyotr, a radical willing to go to any lengths for his ideals, take charge of a crew of anarchists, nihilists, and other politically minded outsiders. When one of the conspirators faces exposure, the gang's response results in a shocking orgy of bloodshed.<br>Written in 1872, Dostoyevsky's cautionary tale explores the destructive forces of demagoguery and unbridled rhetoric. The novel examines how breakdowns in civil behavior beget violence and chaos, leading ordinary people to commit extraordinary crimes. Fascinating for its character portraits and for its truths about people as political animals, <i>Demons</i> remains highly relevant for modern readers.</p><p>With his sympathetic portrayals of the downtrodden of 19th-century Russian society, Fyodor Dostoyevsky (1821&#x2013;1881) exercised immense influence on modern writers. His novels featured profound philosophical and psychological insights that anticipated the development of psychoanalysis and existentialism.</p><h2>Stephen Shore: American Surfaces: Revised &amp; Expanded Edition</h2><p><p><b>An updated edition of Shore's groundbreaking book, now with previously unpublished photographs and a new introduction</b></p><p>Stephen Shore's images from his travels across America in 1972-73 are considered the benchmark for documenting the extraordinary in the ordinary and continue to influence photographers today.

Now, in the age of Instagram and nearly 50 years after Shore embarked on his cross-country journey, this revised and expanded edition will bring this seminal work back into focus.</p></p><p><p><b>Stephen Shore</b> is one of the most influential living photographers.

Cynthia Enloe pulls back the curtain on the familiar scenes&#x2014;governments promoting tourism, companies moving their factories overseas, soldiers serving on foreign soil&#x2014;and shows that the real landscape is not exclusively male. She describes how many women's seemingly personal strategies&#x2014;in their marriages, in their housework, in their coping with ideals of beauty&#x2014;are, in reality, the stuff of global politics. In exposing policymakers' reliance on false notions of "femininity" and "masculinity," Enloe dismantles an apparently overwhelming world system, revealing it to be much more fragile and open to change than we think.</p><p>"I have no hesitation in describing <i>Bananas, Beaches and Bases</i> as the most significant book in contemporary feminist International Politics. Each time I re-visit it, I am taken aback by its profound implications for both feminism and International Politics. The deceptively provocative question at its core 'where are the women?' irrevocably transforms our views about what the central and important landscape of global politics is. In my view, it is the essential text not only for feminist International Politics courses but for anyone interested in starting to understand just how International Politics really works." Marysia Zalewski, author of <i>Feminism After Postmodernism: Theorising Through Practice</i><br><br>"A new edition of <i>Bananas, Beaches, and Bases</i> is cause for cosmic good cheer. This trailblazing treatment of the gender politics of global market and military projects is a feminist classic. Always ahead of the curve, before globalization had achieved cache in academic circles Enloe was there, cajoling Western feminists out of our political parochialism. There is no more creative, insightful, engaging feminist guide to international politics. Cynthia Enloe is an international feminist treasure, and <i>Bananas, Beaches, and Bases</i> her signature work." Judith Stacey, author of <i>Brave New Families</i><br><br>"<i>Bananas, Beaches, and Bases</i> is both a Pandora's Box&#x2019; and a roadmap: It unleashes questions and insights that many conventional students of International Politics are accustomed to ignoring or overlooking about the dynamic between gender and international political life, and it guides us to see how both are mutually constitutive. As the "magna carta" of Feminist International Relations, it has helped create a new generation of women and men in the world of international relations." Katharine Moon, author of <i>Sex Among Allies</i><br><br>"Cynthia Enloe writes with passion, conviction, intelligence and verve as she makes such good feminist sense of international politics that the world never looks quite the same again. Innovative and a great read, <i>Bananas, Beaches and Bases</i> continues to be an outstanding example of the difference gender makes in social analysis. This is a book which provokes discussion with students, colleagues, friends and family. It is a book which has set the standard form much that followed. A classic." Diane Bell, author of <i>Ngarrindjeri Wurrurwarrin: A World That Is, Was, and Will Be</i><br><br>"With this volume, Cynthia Enloe single-handedly carved out a major new field. Combining contemporary political insight and historical sensitivity, <i>Bananas, Beaches and Bases </i>revealed the gendered workings of high politics, without which the entire machinery of war, diplomacy and governance would have long since collapsed. A pioneering tour-de-force."

Then Mary learns the story of the late Mrs. Craven, the estate&#x2019;s mistress, who spent hours in a walled garden tending to her roses. Mrs. Craven died after an accident in the garden, and her forlorn husband forbid anyone to enter it again, locking it and burying the key. The tale piques Mary&#x2019;s curiosity and inspires her to find this secret garden, a search that introduces her to new friends, including a robin redbreast; Dickson, a twelve-year-old boy with a kindness to animals; and Colin, her secluded sickly first-cousin.

During the years between the Treaty of Paris and the Treaty of Wangxi, Americans first voyaged past the Cape of Good Hope, reaching the ports of Algiers and the bazaars of Arabia, the markets of India and the beaches of Sumatra, the villages of Cochin, China, and the factories of Canton. Their South Seas voyages of commerce and discovery introduced the infant nation to the world and the world to what the Chinese, Turks, and others dubbed the "new people."</p><p>Drawing on private journals, letters, ships&#x2019; logs, memoirs, and newspaper accounts, Dane A. Morrison's <i>True Yankees</i> traces America&#x2019;s earliest encounters on a global stage through the exhilarating experiences of five Yankee seafarers. Merchant Samuel Shaw spent a decade scouring the marts of China and India for goods that would captivate the imaginations of his countrymen. Mariner Amasa Delano toured much of the Pacific hunting seals. Explorer Edmund Fanning circumnavigated the globe, touching at various Pacific and Indian Ocean ports of call. In 1829, twenty-year-old Harriett Low reluctantly accompanied her merchant uncle and ailing aunt to Macao, where she recorded trenchant observations of expatriate life. And sea captain Robert Bennet Forbes&#x2019;s last sojourn in Canton coincided with the eruption of the First Opium War. </p><p>How did these bold voyagers approach and do business with the people in the region, whose physical appearance, practices, and culture seemed so strange? And how did native men and women&#x2015;not to mention the European traders who were in direct competition with the Americans&#x2015;regard these upstarts who had fought off British rule? The accounts of these adventurous travelers reveal how they and hundreds of other mariners and expatriates influenced the ways in which Americans defined themselves, thereby creating a genuinely brash national character&#x2015;the "true Yankee." Readers who love history and stories of exploration on the high seas will devour this gripping tale.</p></p><p><p>After breaking free from British rule, American identity had more to do with sailing to the East than trekking into the West.</p><p><b>Dane A.

This beautiful book, which examines various aspects of Signac&#39;s career and reproduces in color some two hundred of his paintings, drawings, watercolors, and prints, is an unprecedented overview of his art and influence. The book traces Signac&#39;s artistic development, which began with the luminous plein air paintings he made in the early 1880s, continued with his explorations of color harmony, contrasts, and neoimpressionist technique made in close association with Georges Seurat, and culminated with the scintillating works of his maturity, in which the rigors of pointillism gave way to richly patterned, decorative color surfaces. Essays discuss Signac&#39;s triumphs as a painter, draftsman, watercolorist, and printmaker, examine his role as a promoter of his own works and those of his colleagues, and shed new light on his appreciation of the works of his predecessors, contemporaries, and followers. The volume also includes an annotated chronology and a map that pinpoints the sites depicted in Signac&#39;s works.</p><p>While Georges Seurat is the best-known pointillist, he wasn't the only one. <i>Signac: 1863-1935</i> reintroduces a tireless advocate of neo-impressionism, a painter whose suburban imagery and leisured lifestyle belied his left-wing political views. Lively essays by scholars and curators portray different facets of Paul Signac's career. Virtually self-taught, he found the catalyst for his mature style in the small-scale brushwork of the slightly older Seurat, but replaced his serene, formal quality with overtly decorative patterning. As a yachtsman, Signac was drawn to marine subjects such as boats gliding on sparkling water at different times of day. After moving from Paris to Saint-Tropez in 1892, he took up watercolor, ideal for painting sunsets. Attempts at translating his political convictions into art (culminating with the monumental figure of a worker wielding a pickax) met with failure. But Signac's brilliance as a colorist is indisputable, infusing each of the 223 plates in this handsome book. <i>--Cathy Curtis</i>This book is the catalogue of the first retrospective of Signac&#39;s work in nearly forty years, which has been held at the R�union des Mus�es Nationaux/Mus�e d&#39;Orsay, Paris, and the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, and will be at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York from October 9 to December 30, 2001.</p><h2>No Other Name? (American Society of Missiology)</h2><p>An honest discussion regarding how devout Christians should react to the academic evidence and genuine personal experience that other religious ways result in engaged, loving and moral lives. Does being saved, by the Christian definition, require a faith in Jesus Christ - meaning the historical person - or rather is it only important that human beings life their lives in accordance to His teachings. This books argues that one can be committed to a savior of some other name, and simultaneously be aligned with Christian theologically and commitment.</p><p>Paul Knitter Served as a Divine Word missionary before assuming a position at Xavier University, Cincinnati, where he is presently Professor of Theology.

Children can draw their own "comic strips" to show what they are thinking and feeling about events or people. Different colors can represent different states of mind. These deceptively simple comic strips can reveal as well as convey quite a lot of substantive information. </p> <p> The author delves into topics such as: </p> <li>What is a Comic Strip Conversation? </li> <li>The Comic Strip Symbols Dictionary </li> <li>Drawing &#x201c;small talk" </li> <li>Drawing about a given situation </li> <li>Drawing about an upcoming situation </li> <p> Feelings and COLOR </p></p><p><p>Carol Gray has over twenty years of experience educating students with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD).

Schatz takes us through the rise and fall of individual careers and the making and unmaking of movies such as <i>Frankenstein</i>, <i>Casablanca</i>, and Hitchcock&#x2019;s <i>Notorious</i>. Through detailed analysis of major Hollywood moviemakers including Universal, Warner Bros., and MGM, he reminds us of a time when studios had distinct personalities and the relationship between contracts and creativity was not mutually exclusive.</p><p><p>Thomas Schatz is professor of communication at the University of Texas, Austin. He is the author of several books, including<i> Hollywood Genres and Boom and Bust: American Cinema in the 1940s</i>.</p>Several other histories of Hollywood's studio system have already been published, including Robert Stanley's The Celluloid Empire (LJ 5/15/78), Douglas Gomery's The Hollywood Studio System (LJ 1/86), and Ethan Mordden's The Hollywood Studios (LJ 5/15/88). All these books have some value, but Mordden and Schatz win top honors. Larger libraries should purchase both books, as they complement each other. Mordden's primary interest is aesthetics; Schatz's is business. Mordden's writing is sometimes brilliant, while Schatz's is only good, but Schatz has obviously done a lot of research, and he puts it to good use in a very readable book.

Kuhn's argument that scientific knowledge does not develop cumulatively, but rather proceeds by a series of "paradigm shifts," captivated not only philosophers of science, but scholars in a wide range of academic disciplines. <i>The Road Since Structure</i> is a follow-up to his landmark work and a look at Kuhn's theory since the book's original publication in 1962. <p> In keeping with Kuhn's wishes (he died in 1996), editors James Conant and John Haugeland organized <i>The Road Since Structure</i> to include 11 philosophical essays written since 1970. In the first part of the book, Kuhn spells out his theory as it developed in the 1980s and 1990s; in the second part, he replies to a number of criticisms and misreadings. The third section is a fascinating interview with Kuhn conducted less than a year before he died. For general interest readers, the lengthy interview--in which Kuhn candidly and engagingly discusses the trials and tribulations of his life and philosophical career--will probably be the most interesting part of the book. For those attuned to Kuhn's controversial work, <i>The Road Since Structure</i> is an indispensable aid for understanding his theory as it developed and for appreciating the full force of his replies to a host of critical objections. As always, Kuhn's clarity and fluid prose render accessible a field fraught with opaque writing. <i>--Eric de Place</i></p>Thomas Kuhn's <i>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i>, published in 1962, is one of the most important works of our time. It has been translated into twenty five languages, and the English edition alone has sold more than one million copies. <i>Structure</i> established Kuhn as the century's most influential philosopher of science, but during the last twenty years of his life, Kuhn was radically rethinking the central concepts of that work. When he died in 1996, he left an unfinished sequel to <i>Structure</i> and a plan for a collection of essays written since 1970.<br><br>Divided into three parts, <i>The Road since Structure</i> is the fullest record we now have of the new direction Kuhn was taking during the last two decades of his life. The first part of the book consists of essays, philosophical rather than historical in nature, in which Kuhn refines the basic concepts set forth in <i>Structure&#x2014;paradigm</i> shifts, incommensurability, and the nature of scientific progress. In part two, Kuhn replies at length to criticisms of his earlier work. Here the reader will find Kuhn arguing his position with some of the most significant philosophers of the time, including Paul Feyerabend and Karl Popper.<br><br>The third part of the volume is the transcript of a remarkable autobiographical interview with Kuhn conducted in Athens in 1995, not quite a year before his death. Here, the usually reticent Kuhn discusses his own intellectual development&#x2014;his family and upbringing, his education, the influence of his training as a physicist, his war work, his relations with his colleagues, the responses to<i> Structure&#x2014;as</i> well as his struggles to define his philosophical position both before and after that landmark work.<br><br><i>The Road since Structure</i> is the definitive companion to <i>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i>. Forceful and accessible, it illuminates and further develops Kuhn's classic book, and it will intrigue everyone who has been engaged by <i>Structure</i> and the debates it launched. In it they will find the story not only of Kuhn's development but also of the man himself.</p><h2>Toasty Toes: Counting by Tens (Know Your Numbers)</h2><p>Introduces counting by tens by counting the number of toes on the beach.</p><p>Michael Dahl is the prolific author of the bestselling Goodnight, Baseball picture book and more than 200 other books for children and young adults.

An effective testing strategy will deliver new functionality more aggressively, accelerate user feedback, and improve quality. However, for many developers, creating effective automated tests is a unique and unfamiliar challenge.</p> <p> <b> <i>xUnit Test Patterns</i> </b> is the definitive guide to writing automated tests using xUnit, the most popular unit testing framework in use today. Agile coach and test automation expert Gerard Meszaros describes 68 proven patterns for making tests easier to write, understand, and maintain. He then shows you how to make them more robust and repeatable--and far more cost-effective.</p> <p>Loaded with information, this book feels like three books in one. The first part is a detailed tutorial on test automation that covers everything from test strategy to in-depth test coding. The second part, a catalog of 18 frequently encountered "test smells," provides trouble-shooting guidelines to help you determine the root cause of problems and the most applicable patterns. The third part contains detailed descriptions of each pattern, including refactoring instructions illustrated by extensive code samples in multiple programming languages.</p> <p>Topics covered include</p> <ul> <li>Writing better tests--and writing them faster </li> <li>The four phases of automated tests: fixture setup, exercising the system under test, result verification, and fixture teardown </li> <li>Improving test coverage by isolating software from its environment using Test Stubs and Mock Objects </li> <li>Designing software for greater testability </li> <li>Using test "smells" (including code smells, behavior smells, and project smells) to spot problems and know when and how to eliminate them </li> <li>Refactoring tests for greater simplicity, robustness, and execution speed</li> </ul> <p>This book will benefit developers, managers, and testers working with any agile or conventional development process, whether doing test-driven development or writing the tests last. While the patterns and smells are especially applicable to all members of the xUnit family, they also apply to next-generation behavior-driven development frameworks such as RSpec and JBehave and to other kinds of test automation tools, including recorded test tools and data-driven test tools such as Fit and FitNesse.<br> </p> <p> <br> </p> <i>Visual Summary of the Pattern Language&nbsp;</i> <i> <br> Foreword </i> <i> <br> Preface </i> <i> <br> Acknowledgments </i> <i> <br> Introduction </i> <i> <br> Refactoring a Test </i> <br> PART I: The Narratives <br> Chapter 1 A Brief Tour<br> Chapter 2 Test Smells <br> Chapter 3 Goals of Test Automation <br> Chapter 4 Philosophy of Test Automation <br> Chapter 5 Principles of Test Automation <br> Chapter 6 Test Automation Strategy <br> Chapter 7 xUnit Basics <br> Chapter 8 Transient Fixture Management <br> Chapter 9 Persistent Fixture Management <br> Chapter 10 Result Verification <br> Chapter 11 Using Test Doubles <br> Chapter 12 Organizing Our Tests <br> Chapter 13 Testing with Databases <br> Chapter 14 A Roadmap to Effective Test Automation <br> PART II: The Test Smells&nbsp; <br> Chapter 15 Code Smells <br> Chapter 16 Behavior Smells <br> Chapter 17 Project Smells <br> PART III: The Patterns&nbsp; <br> Chapter 18 Test Strategy Patterns <br> Chapter 19 xUnit Basics Patterns <br> Chapter 20 Fixture Setup Patterns <br> Chapter 21 Result Verification Patterns <br> Chapter 22 Fixture Teardown Patterns <br> Chapter 23 Test Double Patterns <br> Chapter 24 Test Organization Patterns <br> Chapter 25 Database Patterns <br> Chapter 26 Design-for-Testability Patterns <br> Chapter 27 Value Patterns <br> PART IV: Appendixes <br> Appendix A Test Refactorings &nbsp;<br> Appendix B xUnit Terminology&nbsp; <br> Appendix C xUnit Family Members <br> Appendix D Tools <br> Appendix E Goals and Principles <br> Appendix F Smells, Aliases, and Causes <br> Appendix G Patterns, Aliases, and Variations <br> <i>Glossary </i> <i> <br> References&nbsp;</i> <i> <br> Index&nbsp;</i> <p> <br> </p></p><p><b>Gerard Meszaros</b> is Chief Scientist and Senior Consultant at ClearStream Consulting, a Calgary-based consultancy specializing in agile development. He has more than a decade of experience with automated unit testing frameworks and is a leading expert in test automation patterns, refactoring of software and tests, and design for testability.<p><b>The Value of Self-Testing Code </b></p> <p>In Chapter 4 of <i>Refactoring</i> Ref, Martin Fowler writes: </p> <p> <i>If you look at how most programmers spend their time, you'll find that writing code is actually a small fraction. Some time is spent figuring out what ought to be going on, some time is spent designing, but most time is spent debugging. I'm sure every reader can remember long hours of debugging, often long into the night. Every programmer can tell a story of a bug that took a whole day (or more) to find. Fixing the bug is usually pretty quick, but finding it is a nightmare. And then when you do fix a bug, there's always a chance that anther one will appear and that you might not even notice it until much later. Then you spend ages finding that bug. </i> </p> <p>Some software is very difficult to test manually. In these cases, we are often forced into writing test programs. </p> <p>I recall a project I was working on in 1996. My task was to build an event framework that would let client software register for an event and be notified when some other software raised that event (the Observer GOF pattern). I could not think of a way to test this framework without writing some sample client software. I had about 20 different scenarios I needed to test, so I coded up each scenario with the requisite number of observers, events, and event raisers. At first, I logged what was occurring in the console and scanned it manually. This scanning became very tedious very quickly. </p> <p>Being quite lazy, I naturally looked for an easier way to perform this testing. For each test I populated a Dictionary indexed by the expected event and the expected receiver of it with the name of the receiver as the value. When a particular receiver was notified of the event, it looked in the Dictionary for the entry indexed by itself and the event it had just received. If this entry existed, the receiver removed the entry. If it didn't, the receiver added the entry with an error message saying it was an unexpected event notification. </p> <p>After running all the tests, the test program merely looked in the Dictionary and printed out its contents if it was not empty. As a result, running all of my tests had a nearly zero cost. The tests either passed quietly or spewed a list of test failures. I had unwittingly discovered the concept of a Mock Object (page 544) and a Test Automation Framework (page 298) out of necessity! </p> <p><b>My First XP Project </b></p> <p>In late 1999, I attended the OOPSLA conference, where I picked up a copy of Kent Beck's new book, <i>eXtreme Programming Explained</i> XPE. I was used to doing iterative and incremental development and already believed in the value of automated unit testing, although I had not tried to apply it universally. I had a lot of respect for Kent, whom I had known since the first PLoP1 conference in 1994. For all these reasons, I decided that it was worth trying to apply eXtreme Programming on a ClearStream Consulting project. Shortly after OOPSLA, I was fortunate to come across a suitable project for trying out this development approach--namely, an add-on application that interacted with an existing database but had no user interface. The client was open to developing software in a different way. </p> <p>We started doing eXtreme Programming "by the book" using pretty much all of the practices it recommended, including pair programming, collective ownership, and test-driven development. Of course, we encountered a few challenges in figuring out how to test some aspects of the behavior of the application, but we still managed to write tests for most of the code. Then, as the project progressed, I started to notice a disturbing trend: It was taking longer and longer to implement seemingly similar tasks. </p> <p>I explained the problem to the developers and asked them to record on each task card how much time had been spent writing new tests, modifying existing tests, and writing the production code. Very quickly, a trend emerged. While the time spent writing new tests and writing the production code seemed to be staying more or less constant, the amount of time spent modifying existing tests was increasing and the developers' estimates were going up as a result. When a developer asked me to pair on a task and we spent 90% of the time modifying existing tests to accommodate a relatively minor change, I knew we had to change something, and soon! </p> <p>When we analyzed the kinds of compile errors and test failures we were experiencing as we introduced the new functionality, we discovered that many of the tests were affected by changes to methods of the system under test (SUT). This came as no surprise, of course. What was surprising was that most of the impact was felt during the fixture setup part of the test and that the changes were not affecting the core logic of the tests. </p> <p>This revelation was an important discovery because it showed us that we had the knowledge about how to create the objects of the SUT scattered across most of the tests. In other words, the tests knew too much about nonessential parts of the behavior of the SUT. I say "nonessential" because most of the affected tests did not care about how the objects in the fixture were created; they were interested in ensuring that those objects were in the correct state. Upon further examination, we found that many of the tests were creating identical or nearly identical objects in their test fixtures. </p> <p>The obvious solution to this problem was to factor out this logic into a small set of Test Utility Methods (page 599). There were several variations: </p> <ul> <li>When we had a bunch of tests that needed identical objects, we simply created a method that returned that kind of object ready to use. We now call these Creation Methods (page 415). </li> <li>Some tests needed to specify different values for some attribute of the object. In these cases, we passed that attribute as a parameter to the Parameterized Creation Method (see Creation Method). </li> <li>Some tests wanted to create a malformed object to ensure that the SUT would reject it. Writing a separate Parameterized Creation Method for each attribute cluttered the signature of our Test Helper (page 643), so we created a valid object and then replaced the value of the One Bad Attribute (see Derived Value on page 718). </li> </ul>We had discovered what would become2 our first test automation patterns. <p>Later, when tests started failing because the database did not like the fact that we were trying to insert another object with the same key that had a unique constraint, we added code to generate the unique key programmatically. We called this variant an Anonymous Creation Method (see Creation Method) to indicate the presence of this added behavior. </p> <p>Identifying the problem that we now call a Fragile Test (page 239) was an important event on this project, and the subsequent definition of its solution patterns saved this project from possible failure. Without this discovery we would, at best, have abandoned the automated unit tests that we had already built. At worst, the tests would have reduced our productivity so much that we would have been unable to deliver on our commitments to the client. As it turned out, we were able to deliver what we had promised and with very good quality. Yes, the testers3 still found bugs in our code because we were definitely missing some tests. Introducing the changes needed to fix those bugs, once we had figured out what the missing tests needed to look like, was a relatively straightforward process, however. </p> <p>We were hooked. Automated unit testing and test-driven development really did work, and we have been using them consistently ever since. </p> <p>As we applied the practices and patterns on subsequent projects, we have run into new problems and challenges. In each case, we have "peeled the onion" to find the root cause and come up with ways to address it. As these techniques have matured, we have added them to our repertoire of techniques for automated unit testing. </p> <p>We first described some of these patterns in a paper presented at XP2001. In discussions with other participants at that and subsequent conferences, we discovered that many of our peers were using the same or similar techniques. That elevated our methods from "practice" to "pattern" (a recurring solution to a recurring problem in a context). The first paper on test smells RTC was presented at the same conference, building on the concept of code smells first described in Ref. </p> <p><b>My Motivation </b></p> <p>I am a great believer in the value of automated unit testing. I practiced software development without it for the better part of two decades, and I know that my professional life is much better with it than without it. I believe that the xUnit framework and the automated tests it enables are among the truly great advances in software development. I find it very frustrating when I see companies trying to adopt automated unit testing but being unsuccessful because of a lack of key information and skills. </p> <p>As a software development consultant with ClearStream Consulting, I see a lot of projects. Sometimes I am called in early on a project to help clients make sure they "do things right." More often than not, however, I am called in when things are already off the rails. As a result, I see a lot of "worst practices" that result in test smells. If I am lucky and I am called early enough, I can help the client recover from the mistakes. If not, the client will likely muddle through less than satisfied with how TDD and automated unit testing worked--and the word goes out that automated unit testing is a waste of time. </p> <p>In hindsight, most of these mistakes and best practices are easily avoidable given the right knowledge at the right time. But how do you obtain that knowledge without making the mistakes for yourself? At the risk of sounding self-serving, hiring someone who has the knowledge is the most time-efficient way of learning any new practice or technology. According to Gerry Weinberg's "Law of Raspberry Jam" SoC,4 taking a course or reading a book is a much less effective (though less expensive) alternative. I hope that by writing down a lot of these mistakes and suggesting ways to avoid them, I can save you a lot of grief on your project, whether it is fully agile or just more agile than it has been in the past--the "Law of Raspberry Jam" not withstanding. </p> <p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p> <p>I have written this book primarily for software developers (programmers, designers, and architects) who want to write better tests and for the managers and coaches who need to understand what the developers are doing and why the developers need to be cut enough slack so they can learn to do it even better!

The Panchatantra is a collection of Indian animal fables, known in Europe as the Fables of Bidpai. The original work was in Sanskrit, and could have been written anytime between 100 BC and 500 AD though some of the tales contained in it can be traced as far back as 1500 BC to the Rig-Veda. The original text is a mixture of prose and verse, with the stories contained in one of five frame stories. The introduction, which acts as an enclosing frame for the entire work, attributes the tales to a learned Brahmin called Vishnusharma, who used these stories to teach worldly wisdom to the three dull-witted sons of a king.</p><p>Arthur Ryder, a Professor of Sanskrit at the University of California, translated the Sanskrit original into English in 1925. This re-write of the Ryder translation is aimed at today&#39;s busy reader and the original interwoven stories are presented separately. Archaic English prose makes way for modern language. The Principle clearly and simply summarizes the wisdom imparted at the end of each story. Arthur Ryder&#39;s brilliant introduction and charming verse translations remain untouched.

It had long been his dream to make drugs for healthy people so that Merck could &#34;sell to everyone.&#34; Gadsden&#39;s dream now drives the marketing machinery of the most profitable industry on earth. Drug companies are systematically working to widen the very boundaries that define illness, and the markets for medication grow ever larger. Mild problems are redefined as serious illness and common complaints are labeled as medical conditions requiring drug treatments. Runny noses are now allergic rhinitis, PMS has become a psychiatric disorder, and hyperactive children have ADD. When it comes to conditions like high cholesterol or low bone density, being &#34;at risk&#34; is sold as a disease. Selling Sickness reveals how widening the boundaries of illness and lowering the threshold for treatments is creating millions of new patients and billions in new profits, in turn threatening to bankrupt health-care systems all over the world. As more and more of ordinary life becomes medicalized, the industry moves ever closer to Gadsden&#39;s dream: &#34;selling to everyone.&#34;</p><p>Ray Moynihan is one of the world&#39;s leading health writers.

Alan Cassels is a Canadian researcher and writer who works on drug policy issues.This accessible study about the collusion between medical science and the drug industry emphasizes how drug companies market their products by either redefining problems as diseases (like female sexual dysfunction) or redefining a condition to encompass a greater percentage of the population. Moynihan, a health journalist for the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> and the <i>Lancet,</i> and Cassels, a Canadian science writer, note, for instance, that eight of the nine specialists who wrote the 2004 federal guideline on high cholesterol, which substantially increased the number of people in that category, have multiple financial ties to drug manufacturers. Physicians now routinely prescribe cholesterol-lowering pills (statins) that may have perilous side effects, when many people could lower their risk of heart attack with less costly and dangerous steps, such as exercise and improved diet. Through aggressive merchandising, funding of medical conferences and expensive perks, drug companies win doctors over to diagnosing these "diseases" and prescribing drugs for them.

What further undermined the British Empire was that many of the vessels involved in the trade were themselves British ships.The Royal Navy&#x2019;s response was to dispatch a squadron to patrol Africa&#x2019;s coast. Following what began as a simple policing action, this is the story of the four Royal Naval officers who witnessed how rampant the slave trade remained and made it their personal mission to end it. When the disruption in trade ships started to step on toes within the wealthy merchant class, the campaign was cancelled. However, in the end a coalition of naval officers and abolitionists forced the British government&#x2019;s hand into eradicating the slave trade entirely.Squadron grew from historian John Broich&#x2019;s passion to hunt down firsthand accounts of this untold story. Through research from archives throughout the U.K., Broich tells a tale of defiance in the face of political corruption, while delivering thrills in the tradition of high seas heroism. If it weren&#x2019;t a true story, Squadron would be right at home alongside Patrick O&#x2019;Brian&#x2019;s Master and Commander series.</p><p>John Broich holds a PhD in British History from Stanford University, and is a professor of British Empire history at Case Western Reserve University.

A first novel. 75,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Beverly Swerling</b> is a writer, consultant, and amateur historian. She lives in New York City with her husband.<p><b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> Eleven weeks in a ship thirty-seven feet long by eleven wide, carrying a crew of nine as well as twenty passengers. Lurching and lunging and tossing on the Atlantic swells, the sails creaking night and day, spread above them like some evil bird of prey. Hovering, waiting for death. </p><p> The dung buckets on the open deck were screened only by a scanty calico curtain that blew aside more often than it stayed in place. For Sally Turner the dung buckets were the worst. </p><p> She was twenty-three years old -- small, with dark hair, bright brown eyes, and a narrow, pinched face -- from a Rotterdam slum by way of a rodent-infested corner of a Kentish barn. The crossing had turned her insides to water. She went seven or eight times a day to the dung buckets. The flimsy cloth almost always blew aside and she saw the grizzled, hungry-eyed crewmen watching, waiting for her to lift her skirts. As if all the battles between Kent and now had been for nothing. </p><p> Her brother suffered more from the seasickness. Lucas Turner was a big man, like his sister only in his dark coloring, and in the intelligence that showed behind his eyes. Until now most would have called him handsome; the journey had reduced him to a shell. From the start Lucas hung day and night over the side of the wooden ship, vomiting his guts into the sea. </p><p> The voyage was beyond imagination, beyond bearing. Except that there was no choice but to bear it. One small consolation: the April day when the Princess left Rotterdam was exceptionally warm. A premature summer rushed toward them as they sailed west. Most of the food spoiled before the end of the first three weeks. Constant illness prevented hunger. </p><p> A crossing longer and more miserable and more dangerous than anything they had talked about or prepared for, and when they got there -- what? By all reports bitter cold in winter and fierce heat in summer. "And savages," Sally Turner said the first morning of June, when they were nine weeks into the voyage, and she and her brother were hanging on to the rail in the ship's bow. The swells were stronger in that position, but Lucas was convinced he could be no worse. And there was a bit of privacy. "There are red men in America, Lucas. With painted faces and feathers and hatchets. In God's name, what have we done?" </p><p> Lucas didn't answer. They had decided the risk was worth the taking while they were still in Holland. Besides, he had to lean over the rail and puke yet again. There was nothing in his stomach to come up, even the bile was gone, but the dry heaves would not leave him. </p><p> For as long as Sally could remember, it was Lucas who made such security as there was in her world. She felt every shudder of his agony-racked frame as if it were her own. She slid down, using the wooden ship's planked bulkhead to keep her steady, and pawed through her basket. Eventually she drew herself up and pulled the tiny cork of a small pewter vial. "Chamomile powder, Lucas. Let me shake some onto your tongue." </p><p> "No, that's all you've left. I won't take it." </p><p> "I've more. With our things down below." </p><p> "You're lying, Sal. I can always -- " He had to stop to heave again. </p><p> His sister leaned toward him with the remedy that promised relief. Lucas eyed the small tube with longing. "You're sure you've more?" </p><p> "In our box in the hold. I swear it." </p><p> Lucas opened his mouth. Sally emptied the last few grains of the chamomile powder onto his tongue. It gave him some fifteen minutes of freedom from nausea. </p><p> Below decks, in the sturdy box that held all their belongings carefully wrapped in oilskin, she did indeed have more chamomile, but only in the form of seed. Waiting, like Lucas and Sally Turner, to be planted in Nieuw Amsterdam and thrive in the virgin earth of the island of Manhattan. </p><p> * </p><p> There was a wooden wharf of sorts, but two ships were already moored alongside it. The <i>Princess</i> dropped anchor some fifty yards away, and a raft carried them to shore. It wasn't big enough to take everyone in one trip. Lucas and Sally were dispatched on the third. </p><p> They clung together to keep from being pitched overboard, and listened in disbelief to one of the crewmen talk about the calm of the deep, still harbor. "Not too many places on this coast you can raft folks to land like this. But here the bay's flat as a lake when the tide's with you." Meanwhile it seemed to Lucas and Sally that they were sliding and rolling with each wave, unable to lift their heads and see what they'd come to after their eleven weeks in hell. </p><p> At last, land beneath their feet and they could barely stand on it. They'd experienced the same misery three years before, after the far shorter crossing between England and the Netherlands. "Give it a little time, Sal," her brother said. "We'll be fine." </p><p> Sally looked at what she could see of the place. A piece of crumbling earthworks that was a corner of Fort Amsterdam. A windmill that wasn't turning because there was no breath of air. A gibbet from which was suspended a corpse, covered in pitch and buzzing with flies. And the sun beating down on them. Relentless. "Lucas," she whispered. "Dear God, Lucas." Her brother put a hand on her arm. </p><p> "You there," a voice shouted. "Mijnheer Turner. When you get your legs under you, come over here." </p><p> "There's some shade over by that tree," Lucas murmured. "Wait there. I'll deal with this." </p><p> A couple of rough planks had been spread across two trestles made from saplings. The man seated behind this makeshift table was checking off names on a list. Lucas staggered toward him. The clerk didn't look up. "Turner?" </p><p> "Aye. Lucas Turner. And Sally Turner." </p><p> "English?" </p><p> His accent always gave him away. "Yes, but we're come under the auspices of..." </p><p> "Patroon Van Renselaar. I know. You're assigned to plot number twenty-nine. It's due north of here. Follow the Brede Wegh behind the fort to Wall Street. Take you some ten minutes to walk the length of the town, then you leave by the second gate in the wall. The path begins straightaway on the other side. You'll know your place when you get to it. There are three pine trees one right behind the other, all marked with whiting." </p><p> Lucas bent forward, trying to see the papers in front of the Dutchman. "Is that a map of our land?" </p><p> "It's a map of all the Van Renselaar land. Your piece is included." </p><p> Lucas stretched out his hand. The clerk snatched the papers away. At last, mildly surprised, he looked up. "Can you read, Englishman?" </p><p> "Yes. And I'd like to see your map. Only for a moment." </p><p> The man looked doubtful. "Why? What will it tell you?" </p><p> Lucas was conscious of his clothes hanging loose from his wasted frame, and his face almost covered by weeks of unkempt beard. "For one thing, a look at your map might give me some idea of the distance we must go before we reach those three pine trees." </p><p> "No need for that. I'll tell you. Half a day's walk once you're recovered from the journey." The clerk glanced toward Sally. "Could take a bit longer for a woman. Some of the hills are fairly steep." </p><p> This time when Lucas leaned forward the map wasn't snatched away. He saw one firm line that appeared to divide the town from the countryside, doubtless the wall the clerk had spoken of, and just beyond it what appeared to be a small settlement of sorts. "Our land" -- Lucas pointed to the settlement beyond the wall -- "is it in that part there?" </p><p> "No, that's the Voorstadt, the out-city, a warehouse and the farms that serve the town." The clerk seemed amused by the newcomer's curiosity. He placed a stubby finger on an irregular circle a fair distance beyond the Voorstadt. "And that's the Collect Pond as gives us fresh water to brew beer with. Anything else you'd care to know, Englishman? Shall I arrange a tour?" </p><p> "I was promised land in the town," Lucas said. "But I'll take a place in this Voorstadt. I'm a barber. I can't earn my keep if -- " </p><p> "Your land's where I said it was. You're a farmer now. That's what's needed here." </p><p> "Wait." The voice, a woman's, was imperious. "I wish to speak with this man." A slight figure stepped away from the knot of people standing a little distance from the clerk. Despite the heat she was entirely covered by a hooded cloak of the tightly woven gray stuff the Dutch called duffel. She freed a slender arm long enough to point to Lucas. "Send him to me." </p><p> "Ja, mevrouw, of course." The clerk jerked his head in the woman's direction. "Do as she says," he muttered quietly in the Englishman's direction. "Whatever she says." </p><p> Lucas took a step toward the woman. He removed his black, broad-brimmed hat and held it in front of him, bobbed his head, and waited. </p><p> Her hair was dark, shot with gray and drawn back in a strict bun. Her features were sharp, and when she spoke her lips barely moved, as if afraid they might forget themselves and smile. "I heard you tell the clerk you could read. And that you're a barber." </p><p> "Both are true, mevrouw." </p><p> "Were you then the surgeon on that excuse for a ship?" She nodded toward the Princess riding at anchor in the harbor. "God help all who cross in her." </p><p> "No, mevrouw, I was not." </p><p> "A point in your favor. We are cursed with so-called ship's surgeons in this colony. Ignorant butchers, all of them. You're English, but you speak Dutch. And that miserable craft sailed from Rotterdam, not London. So are you a member of the English Barbers' Company?" </p><p> "I am, mevrouw. But I've lived two years in Rotterdam, and I was told I'd be allowed to practice here exactly as..." </p><p> "I have no reason to think otherwise. And if you know your trade -- " She broke off, chewing on her thin lower lip, studying him. Lucas waited. A number of silent seconds went by; then the woman pointed toward Sally. "I take it that's your wife." </p><p> "No, mevrouw, I am unmarried. That is my sister, Sally Turner." Lucas motioned Sally forward. She didn't come, but she dropped a quick curtsy. </p><p> The woman's eyes betrayed a flicker of amusement. "The <i>juffrouw</i> does not seem particularly obedient, Lucas Turner. Is your sister devoted to you?" </p><p> "I believe she is, mevrouw." </p><p> "Good. I, too, have a brother to whom I am utterly devoted. I am Anna Stuyvesant. My brother is Peter Stuyvesant. He is governor of Nieuw Netherlands. And right now..." </p><p> Sweet Jesus Christ. Bloody Stuyvesant and his bloody sister. When the only thing Lucas wanted, the thing that had made him come to this godforsaken colony at the end of the world, was to be where the authorities would leave him in peace. </p><p> Either his reaction didn't show, or she chose not to notice it. "Right now my brother is in need of a man of great skill. And I am trying to decide, Lucas Turner, if you might be he." </p><p> He had no choice but to seize the moment. "That depends on the nature of the skill your brother requires, mevrouw. I know my trade, if that's what you're asking." </p><p> "It is part of the question. The other part is the precise nature of your trade. Is it true that, though they belong to the same Company, London barbers and surgeons do not practice the same art?" </p><p> Lucas heard Sally's sharply indrawn breath. "Officially yes, mevrouw. But the two apprenticeships occur side by side, in the same hall. A man interested in both skills cannot help but learn both. I am skilled in surgery as well as barbering. What is it the governor requires?" </p><p> The woman's eyes flicked toward Sally for a moment, as if she, too, had noted the gasp. A second only; then she dismissed the younger woman as of no importance. "I believe my brother to be in desperate need of a stone cutter, barber." </p><p> Lucas smiled. </p><p> Finally, for the first time in weeks, he felt no doubt. "Pray God you are correct, mevrouw. If it's an expert stone cutter your brother needs, he is a fortunate man. He has found one." Lucas turned to Sally. She was white-faced. He pretended not to notice. "Come, Sal. Bring my instruments. I've a patient waiting for relief." </p><p> * </p><p> Word was that Peter Stuyvesant ruled with absolute authority and that any who questioned him paid a heavy price. Right then, ashen, sweating with pain, the man lying in the bed looked small and insignificant. </p><p> Lucas put his hand on Stuyvesant's forehead. The flesh was cold and clammy. "Where does it hurt, mijnheer?" </p><p> "In my belly, man. Low down. Fierce pain. And I cannot piss for the burning. My sister is convinced it's a stone." </p><p> Anna Stuyvesant was in the room with them, huddling in the gloom beside the door. Some mention had been made of a wife, and when they arrived Lucas had heard the voices of children, but none had appeared. He'd seen only a black serving woman -- from what he'd heard of this place she was probably a slave -- and the man in the bed. And, in control of all, the sister. Obviously married, or had been, since the clerk at the dock had called her mevrouw, but one who, following the Dutch fashion, hadn't taken her husband's name. Looked like the type who wouldn't take willingly to his cock, either. Lucas was conscious of her fierce glance drilling a hole in his back. </p><p> He leaned closer to the patient, observing the clouded eyes, the pallor, the sour breath that came hard through a half-open mouth. "Judging from the look of you, mijnheer, Mevrouw Stuyvesant may be right. And if she is, if it's a stone, I can help you. But..." He hesitated. Afterward, some men thought of the relief, and were grateful. Others remembered only the agony of the surgery, and those hated you forever. God help him and Sally both if the governor of Nieuw Netherland hated him forever. </p><p> "But what?" Stuyvesant demanded. </p><p> "But it will hurt while I do it," Lucas said, choosing not to dip the truth in honey. "Worse than the pain you're feeling right now. After the operation is over, however, you will be cured." </p><p> "If I live, you mean." </p><p> "The chances are excellent that you will, mijnheer." </p><p> "But not certain." </p><p> "In this world, Mijnheer Governor, nothing is certain. As I'm sure you know. But I've done this surgery dozens of times." </p><p> "And all your patients lived?" Wincing with pain while he spoke. Having to force the words between clenched teeth. </p><p> "Perhaps six or seven did not, mijnheer. But they were men of weak constitution before the stone began plaguing them." </p><p> Stuyvesant studied the Englishman, even managed a small smile. "I am not a man of weak constitution. And you, you're a strange one, barber. Despite your mangled Dutch, you speak like a man with his wits in place. But the way you look, not to mention how you smell...Ach, but then my sister tells me you only just got off the <i>Princess,</i> so per -- " </p><p> The pain must have been savage. The Dutchman gritted his teeth so hard Lucas thought he might break his jaw. The sweat poured off him. </p><p> Lucas leaned forward and wiped the governor's face with a corner of the bedding. Half a minute, maybe less. The wave of agony abated. Stuyvesant drew a few deep breaths. "This operation..." He whispered the words, his strength sapped by the pain. "How long will it take?" </p><p> "Forty-five seconds," Lucas said....</p></p><h2>Mere Civility: Disagreement and the Limits of Toleration</h2><p><p>Today, politicians and intellectuals warn that we face a crisis of civility and a veritable war of words polluting our public sphere. In liberal democracies committed to tolerating diversity as well as active, often heated disagreement, the loss of this conversational virtue appears critical. But is civility really a virtue? Or is it, as critics claim, a covert demand for conformity that silences dissent?</p><p><i>Mere Civility</i> sheds light on our predicament and the impasse between &#x201c;civilitarians&#x201d; and their opponents by examining early modern debates about religious toleration. As concerns about uncivil disagreement achieved new prominence after the Reformation, seventeenth-century figures as different as Roger Williams, Thomas Hobbes, and John Locke could agree that some restraint on the war of words would be necessary. But they recognized that the prosecution of incivility was often difficult to distinguish from persecution. In their efforts to reconcile diversity with disagreement, they developed competing conceptions of civility as the social bond of tolerant societies that still resonate.</p><p>Most modern appeals to civility follow either Hobbes or Locke by proposing to suppress disagreement or exclude persons and positions deemed &#x201c;uncivil&#x201d; for the sake of social concord. Compared with his contemporaries&#x2019; more robust ideals, Williams&#x2019;s unabashedly <i>mere </i>civility&#x2015;a minimal, occasionally contemptuous adherence to culturally contingent rules of respectful behavior&#x2015;is easily overlooked. Yet Teresa Bejan argues that Williams offers a promising path forward in confronting our own crisis of civility, one that fundamentally challenges our assumptions about what a tolerant&#x2015;and civil&#x2015;society should look like.</p></p><p>Teresa M. Bejan is Associate Professor of Political Theory in the Department of Politics and International Relations at the University of Oxford and a Fellow of Oriel College.&#x201c;Penetrating and sophisticated.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>James Ryerson</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Mere Civility</i> is centered in the years after the Reformation, when the emergence of myriad Protestant sects splintered communities across Western Europe. That splintering was magnified, just as in our own time, by the explosion of a new means of communication&#x2015;the printing press&#x2015;which allowed people who had never before had a public voice to spread their ideas far and wide. Invectives and broadsides were the order of the day, as members of different religious denominations fought for each other&#x2019;s souls, and incivility became a central concern of political thought. I doubt that for most readers of <i>Mere Civility</i>, this account of social disarray in the Reformation years is a huge surprise. But by keeping a tight focus on the concept of civility, Bejan manages to make that old story feel new&#x2015;or at least to draw new lessons from it, lessons that are particularly interesting within the context of contemporary political theory... [<i>Mere Civility</i>] does not purport to solve the problems of incivility, but it unknots them, making the nature of the problems&#x2015;both in general and in this time of numbing nostalgia&#x2015;more evident. Would that more of us might learn to look into the past with such gravity and humility. We might end up with a more (or mere) civil society, yet.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Susan McWilliams</b><b>, </b><b><i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A deeply admirable book: original, persuasive, witty, and eloquent.

Three interrelated themes (plate tectonics, organic evolution, and geologic time) help students understand that Earth is a complex, integrated, and continually changing system. In the new edition authors James S. Monroe and Reed Wicander integrate new content emphasizing the economic impacts of geology. Topics such as fracking, nuclear waste, and the threat of earthquakes are covered in new Geo-Impact boxes that stress real-world applications. Lauded for their clear writing style, the authors go beyond simply explaining geology and its processes; rather, they place that knowledge within the context of human experience by consistently emphasizing relevance, resources, and the environment. New Global Geosciences Watch activities help students learn how to use an extensive database of articles on geology that are updated several times a day and are available exclusively for users of this book.</p><p>James S. Monroe is Professor Emeritus of Geology at Central Michigan University, where he taught Physical Geology, Historical Geology, Prehistoric Life, and Stratigraphy and Sedimentology beginning in 1975 and served as chair of the Geology department. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Montana. He has coauthored several textbooks with Reed Wicander and has interests in Cenozoic geology and geologic education. Monroe now lives in Chico, California, where he remains active in geology by teaching courses to a large group of retirees.</p><h2>International Economics</h2><p>Now in its 15th edition, this proven, market-leading book remains a favorite among readers of all backgrounds for its clear, concise treatment of international trade and finance theory.

Three years later, Rauschenberg was invited by Leo Castelli to exhibit in his gallery, by then considered one of the most prestigious avant-garde centers in New York City. Castelli spoke to Rauschenberg about a group show he was planning, and the artist insisted on taking the dealer to Johns' studio. In this book on Johns, one of the greatest artists of our time, Castelli summons up their first meeting. Rauschenberg and Johns had their studios in the same building and Castelli was instantly bowled over by what he saw - American flags of an incredible richness of surface created by the use of encaustic, or melted wax, along with targets and brightly painted series of figures and letters. He instantly took Johns on as part of his stable, astonished that such a brilliant artist was still available. Where his earliest works had sold for around $1,000, the Whitney Museum of American Art paid $1 million for Three Flags in 1973. Johns' works are now among the most valuable pieces of art produced by any living painter.<br>Johns is still with Castelli, who made him more accessible through several series of prints and lithographs. Here, Leo Castelli - in his own words - describes this exhilarating period in American art.</p><p>This little book has an essay at the front by Leo Castelli, the legendary New York art dealer who in the late 1950s snapped up the young Jasper Johns for his stable of new artists--nearly all of whom became wildly successful. Most of the rest of the book is like a snapshot album, immersing the reader in pictures of Johns, his studio, his paintings, and historical artifacts. These last include the <i>Art News</i> magazine cover of 1958 that put Johns on the map. Speaking of maps, there are reproductions of Johns's famous U.S. maps, and also of his targets and the late double shadow, crosshatch paintings. In the back of the book, there is a brief chronology, plus captions explaining the preceding plates. It's a surprisingly good idea to place them at the end--nicely non-intrusive. <p> Read Castelli's essay to get a sense of the renowned and perspicacious Leo Castelli, rather than for what it tells you about Johns. For that, there are hundreds of other sources. One startlingly thoughtful analysis of Johns's work appears in James Fenton's book <i>Leonardo's Nephew</i>. Castelli reveals that MoMA's Tom Hess had "a friend" buy one of Johns's early American flag paintings for the museum in order to bypass a conservative acquisitions committee. Fenton tells us it was the architect Philip Johnson, and that it then took 15 years for MoMA to wrest it from Johnson's appreciative grasp. <i>--Peggy Moorman</i></p></p><h2>Advanced Mechanics of Materials</h2><p>Updated and reorganized, each of the topics is thoroughly developed from fundamental principles.

It is now objectively measurable by the gulf in revenues, by subjective malaise, or by the menace of ecological apocalypse, and also by their constant exacerbation.<br>&#x2015;from <i>How the World Swung to the Right</i></p><p>Despite a few zones of active resistance&#x2015;the alter-globalization movement, the Chiapas uprisings, the Arab springs, and the recent resistance to racialized police brutality and environmental and genocidal warfare in the United States&#x2015;the last half-century has been witness to an undeniable global shift to the right. <i>How the World Swung to the Right</i> provides a comprehensive overview of this reactionary, individualist, cynical, and belligerent shift, which often has been cloaked in the guise of entertainment and good intentions. The counterrevolutions began with a first phase of deregulation and ideological counter-attacks, and the fall of the so-called &#x201c;real&#x201d; communisms. The 1990s inaugurated a global biopolitical turn and the financialization of the economy; the 2000s hammered in neoliberal gains through the alliance of ultraliberalism with neoconservatism. These policies were implemented, surprisingly, not only by the right but often by the establishment left. Cusset argues that in the face of this betrayal, conflict is the one thing we can still salvage from the notion of the &#x201c;left.&#x201d; What we need today, he contends, are new sites of conflict that multiply the causes of struggle and the sites of mobilization, linking socioeconomic struggle with questions of identity and the urgency of ecology.</p></p><p>Fran�ois Cusset is Professor of American Studies at the University of Paris-Ouest Nanterre, Fran�ois Cusset is a writer and intellectual historian.

She and her husband Harold Nicolson created the famous garden at Sissinghurst Castle in Kent.Henry Lyulph Holland, first Earl of Slane, had existed for so long that the public had begun to regard him as immortal. The public, as a whole, finds reassurance in longevity, and, after the necessary interlude of reaction, is disposed to recognise extreme old age as a sign of excellence. The long-liver has triumphed over at least one of man&#x2019;s initial handicaps: the brevity of life. To filch twenty years from eternal annihilation is to impose one&#x2019;s superiority on an allotted programme. So small is the scale upon which we arrange our values. It was thus with a start of real incredulity that City men, opening their papers in the train on a warm May morning, read that Lord Slane, at the age of ninety-four, had passed away suddenly after dinner on the previous evening. &#x2018;Heart failure,&#x2019; they said sagaciously, though they were actually quoting from the papers; and then added with a sigh, &#x2018;Well, another old landmark gone.&#x2019; That was the dominant feeling: another old landmark gone, another reminder of insecurity. All the events and progressions of Henry Holland&#x2019;s life were gathered up and recorded in a final burst of publicity by the papers; they were gathered together into a handful as hard as a cricket-ball, and flung in the faces of the public, from the days of his &#x2018;brilliant university career,&#x2019; through the days when Mr Holland, at an astonishingly early age, had occupied a seat in the Cabinet, to this very last day when as Earl of Slane, K.G., G.C.B., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., etc. etc. &#x2013; his diminishing honours trailing away behind him like the tail of a comet &#x2013; he had drooped in his chair after dinner, and the accumulation of ninety years had receded abruptly into history. Time seemed to have made a little jump forward, now that the figure of old Slane was no longer there with outstretched arms to dam it back. For some fifteen years he had taken no very active part in public life, but he had been there, and on occasion the irrefutable suavity, common sense, and mockery of his eloquence in Parliament had disturbed, though it could not actually arrest, his more extreme colleagues upon the brink of folly. Such pronouncements had been rare, for Henry Holland had always been a man to appreciate the value of economy, but by their very rarity they produced a wholesome sense of uneasiness, since men knew them to be backed up by a legend of experience: if the old man, the octogenarian, the nonagenarian, could bestir himself to the extent of stalking down to Westminster and unburdening himself, in his incomparable way, of opinions carefully, soberly, but cynically gestated, then the Press and the public were compelled into attention. Nobody had ever seriously attacked Lord Slane. Nobody had ever accused Lord Slane of being a back-number. His humour, his charm, his languor, and his good sense, had rendered him sacrosanct to all generations and to all parties; of him alone among statesmen and politicians, perhaps, could that be said. Perhaps, because he seemed to have touched life on every side, and yet never seemed to have touched life, the common life, at all, by virtue of his proverbial detachment, he had never drawn upon himself the execration and mistrust commonly accorded to the mere expert. Hedonist, humanist, sportsman, philosopher, scholar, charmer, wit; one of those rare Englishmen whose fortune it is to be born equipped with a truly adult mind. His colleagues and his subordinates had been alternately delighted and infuriated by his assumed reluctance to deal with any practical question. It was difficult to get a yes or a no out of the man. The more important a question was, the more flippantly he dealt with it. &#x2018;Yes,&#x2019; he would write at the bottom of a memorandum setting forth the advantages of two opposite lines of policy; and his myrmidons passed their hands over their brows, distraught. He was destroyed as a statesman, they said, because he always saw both sides of the case; but even as they said it with exasperation, they did not mean it, for they knew that on occasion, when finally pushed into a corner, he would be more incisive, more deadly, than any man seated four-square and full of importance at a governmental desk. He could cast his eye over a report, and pick out its heart and its weakness before another man had had time to read it through. In his exquisitely courteous way, he would annihilate alike the optimism and the myopia of his correspondent. Courteous always, and civilised, he left his competitors dead.<br><br>&nbsp;His personal idiosyncrasies, too, were dear to the public as to the caricaturists; his black satin stock, his eyeglass swung on an extravagantly wide ribbon, the coral buttons to his evening waistcoat, the private hansom he maintained long after motors had come into fashion &#x2013; by all this was he buttressed through the confused justice and injustice of legend; and when, at the age of eighty-five, he finally succeeded in winning the Derby, no man ever received a greater ovation. His wife alone suspected how closely those idiosyncrasies were associated with a settled policy. The least cynical of people by nature, she had learned to lay a veneer of cynicism over herself after seventy years&#x2019; association with Henry Holland. &#x2018;Dear old man,&#x2019; said the City men in the train; &#x2018;well, he&#x2019;s gone.&#x2019;<br><br>He was gone indeed, very finally and irretrievably gone. So thought his widow, looking down at him as he lay on his bed in Elm Park Gardens. The blinds were not lowered, for he had always stipulated that when he came to die the house should not be darkened, and even after his death nobody would have dreamed of disobeying his orders. He lay there in the full sunlight, sparing the stone-mason the trouble of carving his effigy. His favourite great-grandchild, to whom everything was permitted, had often twitted him, saying that he would make a handsome corpse; and now that the joke had become a reality, the reality gained in impressiveness for having been anticipated by a joke. His was the type of face which, even in life, one associates prophetically with the high dignity of death. The bony architecture of nose, chin, and temples, stood out in greater relief for the slight sinking of the flesh; the lips took a firmer line, and a lifetime of wisdom lay sealed behind them. Moreover, and most importantly, Lord Slane looked as soign� in death as he had looked in life. &#x2018;Here,&#x2019; you would say, even though the bedclothes covered him, &#x2018;is a dandy.&#x2019;<br><br>Yet, for all its dignity, death brought a revelation. The face which had been so noble in life lost a trifle of its nobility in death; the lips which had been too humorous to be unpleasantly sardonic now betrayed their thinness; the carefully concealed ambition now revealed itself fully in the proud curve of the nostril. The hardness which had disguised itself under the charming manner now remained alone, robbed of the protection of a smile. He was beautiful, but he was less agreeable. Alone in the room his widow contemplated him, filled with thoughts that would greatly have surprised her children, could they but have read her mind.<br><br>Her children, however, were not there to observe her. They were collected in the drawing-room, all six of them; two wives and a husband bringing the number up to nine. A sufficiently formidable family gathering &#x2013; old, black ravens, thought Edith, the youngest, who was always flustered and always trying to confine things into the shape of a phrase, like pouring water into a ewer, but great gouts of meaning and implication invariably ran over and slopped about and were lost. To attempt to recapture them after they had spilt was as hopeless as trying to hold the water in your hand. Perhaps, if one had a notebook and pencil always ready &#x2013; but then the thought would be lost while one was looking for the right word; and, moreover, it would be difficult to use a notebook without everybody seeing. Shorthand? &#x2013; but one must not let one&#x2019;s thoughts run on like this; one must discipline one&#x2019;s mind, keeping one&#x2019;s attention on the present matter, as other people seemed to do without any difficulty; though, to be sure, if one had not learnt that lesson by the time one was sixty, one was never likely to learn it. A formidable family gathering, thought Edith, coming back: Herbert, Carrie, Charles, William, and Kay; Mabel, Lavinia; Roland. They went in groups: the Hollands themselves, the sisters-in-law, the brother-in-law; then they sorted themselves differently: Herbert and Mabel, Carrie and Roland; Charles; William and Lavinia; and then Kay all by himself. It was not often that they all met together, none missing &#x2013; curious, Edith thought, that Death should be the convener, as though all the living rushed instantly together for protection and mutual support. Dear me, how old we all are. Herbert must be sixty-eight, and I&#x2019;m sixty; and Father was over ninety, and Mother is eighty-eight. Edith, who had begun making a sum of their total ages, surprised them all very much by asking, &#x2018;How old are you, Lavinia?&#x2019; Thus taken aback, they rebuked Edith by their stare; but that was Edith all over, she never listened to what was being said, and then suddenly came out with some irrelevant remark. Edith could have told them that all her life she had been trying to say what she meant, and had never yet succeeded. Only too often, she said something precisely the opposite of what she wanted to say. Her terror was that she should one day use an indecent word by mistake. &#x2018;Isn&#x2019;t it splendid that Father is dead,&#x2019; she might say, instead of, &#x2018;Isn&#x2019;t it terrible&#x2019;; and there were other possibilities, even more appalling, by which one might use a really dreadful word,&nbsp; the sort of word that butcher-boys scrawled in pencil on the white-washed walls of the basement passage, and about which one had to speak, most evasively, to the cook. An unpleasant task; the sort of task that fell to Edith in Elm Park Gardens and to a thousand Ediths all over London. But of these preoccupations her family knew nothing.<br><br>They were gratified now to see that she blushed, and that her hands went up nervously to fiddle with the grey strands of her hair; the gesture implied that she had not spoken. Having reduced her to this confusion, they returned to their conversation, suitably hushed and mournful. Even the voices of Herbert and Carrie, habitually insistent, were lowered. Their father lay upstairs, and their mother was with him.<br><br>&#x2018;Mother is wonderful.&#x2019;<br><br>Over and over, thought Edith, they had reiterated that phrase. Surprise was in their accents, as though they had expected their mother to rant, rave, scream, give herself up for lost. Edith knew very well that her brothers and sister privately entertained a theory that their mother was rather a simpleton. From time to time she let fall remarks that could not be reconciled with ordinary sense; she had no grasp on the world as it was; she was apt to say impetuous things which, although uttered in English, made no more sense than had they been uttered in an outer-planetary language. Mother was a changeling, they had often said politely, in the bitter-sweet accents reserved for a family joke; but now in this emergency they found a new phrase: Mother is wonderful. It was the thing they were expected to say, so they said it, several times over, like a refrain coming periodically into their conversation and sweeping it upwards on to a higher level. Then it drooped again; became practical. Mother was wonderful, but what was to be done with Mother? Evidently, she could not go on being wonderful for the rest of her life. Somewhere, somehow, she must be allowed to break down, and then, after that was over, must be stowed away; housed, taken care of. Outside, in the streets, the posters might flare: death of Lord Slane. The journalists might run up and down Fleet Street assembling their copy; they might pounce on the pigeon-holes &#x2013; that macabre columbarium &#x2013; where the obituary notices were stored in readiness; they might raid each other&#x2019;s information: &#x2018;I say, is it true that old Slane always carried his cash in coppers? wore cr�pe soles? dipped his bread in his coffee?&#x2019; Anything to make a good paragraph. Telegraph-boys might ring the bell, propping their red bicycles against the kerb, delivering their brown messages of condolence, from all over the world, from all parts of the Empire, especially where Lord Slane had served his term of government. Florists might deliver their wreaths &#x2013; already the narrow hall was full of them &#x2013; &#x2018;indecently soon,&#x2019; said Herbert, peering jealously nevertheless at the attached cards through his monocle. Old friends might call &#x2013; &#x2018;Herbert &#x2013; so dreadfully sudden &#x2013; of course, I didn&#x2019;t expect to see your dear Mother&#x2014;&#x2019; But obviously they had expected it, had expected to be the sole exception, and Herbert must turn them away, rather enjoying it: &#x2018;Mother, you understand, is naturally rather overcome; wonderful, I must say; but just at present, you&#x2019;ll understand, I&#x2019;m sure, is seeing nobody but Us&#x2019;; and so with many pressings of Herbert&#x2019;s hand they took their departure, having got no further than the hall or the doorstep. Reporters might loiter on the pavement, dangling cameras like black concertinas. All this might go on outside the house, but inside it, upstairs, Mother was with Father and the problem of her future lay heavy upon her sons and daughters.</p><h2>Culturally Responsive Teaching: Theory, Research, and Practice (Multicultural Education Series)</h2><p><p>The achievement of students of color continues to be disproportionately low at all levels of education.

Kristi Dahm is assistant conservator of prints and drawings at the Art Institute of Chicago.</p>Starred Review. Beginning as a lithographer's apprentice, iconic American painter Winslow Homer (1836-1910) learned the basics of drawing and etching without ever receiving a serious artistic education, developing his skill through practical experience and intense observation. As editor and Art Institute of Chicago curator Tedeschi relates, the artist was obsessed with the ability to depict light properly in its limitless incarnations. Though he was accomplished in a variety of mediums, Homer found watercolors to be the most efficient for what Tedeschi calls "his dedicated examination of the relationship between color, light, and water." Besides reproducing a stunning array of Homer's watercolor paintings, the text offers highly specific description of the artist's process and materials, articulating the different uses of opaque and transparent watercolors and varying paper textures in a technical but reader-friendly manner. Though critics agree that Homer's attention to light and color are entirely his own, the text is also thorough in examining Homer's influences, from Impressionism to the English Aesthetic Movement, as well as his conceptual ties to his contemporary, Walt Whitman. The result is a superior read for those seeking an introduction to the medium of watercolors or an exploration of Homer's work. 275 color illustrations. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The repetition of particular characters, images, and story lines&#x2014;of Patients Zero and superspreaders, hot zones and tenacious microbes&#x2014;produced a formulaic narrative as they circulated through the media and were amplified in popular fiction and film. The &#x201c;outbreak narrative&#x201d; begins with the identification of an emerging infection, follows it through the global networks of contact and contagion, and ends with the epidemiological work that contains it. Priscilla Wald argues that we need to understand the appeal and persistence of the outbreak narrative because the stories we tell about disease emergence have consequences. As they disseminate information, they affect survival rates and contagion routes. They upset economies. They promote or mitigate the stigmatizing of individuals, groups, locales, behaviors, and lifestyles. <p></p><p>Wald traces how changing ideas about disease emergence and social interaction coalesced in the outbreak narrative. She returns to the early years of microbiology&#x2014;to the identification of microbes and &#x201c;Typhoid Mary,&#x201d; the first known healthy human carrier of typhoid in the United States&#x2014;to highlight the intertwined production of sociological theories of group formation (&#x201c;social contagion&#x201d;) and medical theories of bacteriological infection at the turn of the twentieth century. Following the evolution of these ideas, Wald shows how they were affected by&#x2014;or reflected in&#x2014;the advent of virology, Cold War ideas about &#x201c;alien&#x201d; infiltration, science-fiction stories of brainwashing and body snatchers, and the HIV/AIDS pandemic. <i>Contagious </i>is a cautionary tale about how the stories we tell circumscribe our thinking about global health and human interactions as the world imagines&#x2014;or refuses to imagine&#x2014;the next Great Plague.</p></p><p>"Contagious is a magnificent book, notable for its prose, its expansiveness, its courage, and its creativity."--Rita Charon, founder of the Program in Narrative Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center <p>"Rippling across the span of the twentieth century, Priscilla Wald's book traces the trajectories of `outbreak narratives,' stories about the spread and conquest of contagious diseases. With beautifully crafted prose, Wald shows how the scientific and fictional, social and microbial intermingle as outbreak narratives confront an essential paradox, that human connectedness both imperils and saves us. Contagious is essential reading for science studies, for the field of literature and medicine, and indeed for anyone interested in the social, discursive, and cultural implications of epidemiology."--N. Katherine Hayles, University of California, Los Angeles </p><p>"Priscilla Wald demonstrates how epidemics are forms of cultural autobiography, telescoping stories of outbreak and contagion that are reflected in our myths, symbols, archetypes, and social networks. Beautifully written and passionately argued, Contagious is required reading for those interested in learning how our diseases shape the ways we think about ourselves and our relationships and how our desires to be close to other people overlap with our anxieties about being infected by them."--Jonathan Metzl, author of Prozac on the Couch: Prescribing Gender in the Era of Wonder Drugs</p>&#34;Priscilla Wald stunningly demonstrates how epidemics are forms of cultural autobiography, telescoping stories of outbreak and contagion that are reflected in our myths, symbols, archetypes, and social networks.

John has used his exemplary knowledge of money to lay out a cogent framework for the transition of society based on fiat money to a more honest society forged by gold. He has taken complexity and given us simplicity. Monetary economics and its interrelationship with geopolitics, finance, and society is extraordinarily complex, but he has managed to assimilate a vast array of information and distill it in a simple and thoroughly thoughtful framework. That is an art many academic writers never achieve."<br>--Ben Davies, cofounder and CEO, Hinde CapitalThe protracted global economic crisis has awakened the long-dormant debate about whether the United States or other countries should reinstate some form of gold standard. While not surprising given that there is now general agreement that excessive money and credit growth played a key role in the near collapse of the global financial system in 2008, in fact a return to gold is inevitable at this point. John Butler makes a compelling case in this book that there is simply no other way to restore a sufficient degree of credibility and trust in the dollar, or other major currencies for that matter, without a return to some form of gold standard.<br><br> Already there are a number of major countries expressing concern about the stability of the dollar. And concern is increasingly giving way to action. As the dollar&#x2032;s role gradually declines, global monetary arrangements are likely to become increasingly multipolar, as there is no single currency that can realistically replace the dollar as the preeminent global monetary reserve. As students of economic history will note, it was precisely a multipolar world amid rapidly growing international trade that ushered in the classical gold standard in the 1870s. The world&#x2032;s 40-year experiment with purely unbacked fiat currencies is thus rapidly approaching its conclusion. <br><br>This book, however, goes much farther than predict a return to gold. It explores just what the transition might look like, including both orderly and disorderly scenarios and drawing on historical examples where relevant. It considers to what extent the price of gold will likely rise as it becomes remonetized. Most important, it prepares the reader with practical investment advice for the coming return to gold, including thoughts on interest rates, exchange rates, credit spreads, equity market valuations, and risk premia for assets in general. As such, John Butler provides not only a compelling vision of the future, but also a detailed road map for navigating what is likely to be the most challenging investment landscape in generations.</p><h2>GED Test Prep Plus 2018: 2 Practice Tests + Proven Strategies + Online (Kaplan Test Prep)</h2><p>Always study with the most up-to-date prep!

Well-loved the world over, his work endures for its ability to speak powerfully to the follies and foibles of human nature.

Introductory Physics Series)</h2><p>This introduction to the study of vibrations and waves is very much focused on mechanical systems. So, a good working knowledge of elementary kinematics and dynamics is advised. The decision to limit the scope of the book in this way was guided by the fact that the presentation is quantitative and analytical rather than descriptive. The temptation to incorporate discussions of electrical and optical systems was always strong, but it was felt that a great part of the language of the subject could be developed most simply and straightforwardly in terms of mechanical displacements and scalar wave equations, with only an occasional allusion to other systems.</p><p></p><h2>Biblical Hebrew: An Introductory Grammar</h2><p>Comprehensive in scope, this carefully crafted introductory grammar of Biblical Hebrew offers easy-to-understand explanations, numerous biblical illustrations, and a wide range of imaginative, biblically based exercises.<br><br> The book consists of thirty-one lessons, each presenting grammatical concepts with examples and numerous exercises judiciously selected from the biblical text.

A principal example used in the book is the hyperfine structure of atomic hydrogen (the 21 cm line): the computation of the energy splitting and the induced and spontaneous transition rates. Peebles makes room for such calculations by omitting unneeded elements that can be readily found in the standard treatises after one fully understands the principles of quantum mechanics. To give a flavor of the discovery of the remarkable world picture of quantum mechanics, the author presents a set of examples of physics that are well worth knowing even aside from their historical interest. Then the general principles of quantum mechanics are stated first in terms of wave mechanics and then in the standard abstract linear space formalism. Measurement theory, an essential part of quantum mechanics, is discussed in some detail. The book also emphasizes the art of numerical estimates. And, lastly, a large number of problems are presented, some easy, some challenging, but all selected because they are physically interesting. The book is designed for advanced undergraduates or beginning graduate students in physics.</p></p><p>P.J.E.

When she's not traipsing after a rabbit into Wonderland, she's gallivanting off into the topsy-turvy world behind the drawing-room looking glass. In <i>Through the Looking Glass</i>, Lewis Carroll's masterful and zany sequel to <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i>, she makes more eccentric acquaintances, including Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the White Queen, and a somewhat grumpy Humpty Dumpty. Through a giant and elaborate chess game, Alice explores this odd country, where one must eat dry biscuits to quench thirst, and run like the wind to stay in one place. As in life, Alice must stay on her toes to learn the rules of this game. <i>Through the Looking Glass</i> immediately took its rightful place beside its partner on the shelf of eternal classics. And luckily for generations of enraptured children, Carroll was again able to persuade John Tenniel to create the fantastic woodblock engravings that have become so indelibly associated with the Alice stories. For almost 130 years, Alice's curious adventures have amused, perplexed, and delighted readers, young and old. This gorgeous, deluxe boxed set of both volumes contains engravings from Tenniel's original woodblocks that were discovered in a London bank in 1985, and reproduced for the first time here.

But the art of rhetoric is not so ancient nor so abstract -- in fact, it has neverbeen so alive as it is today; in a world saturated with advertisements, media reports, andtelevised trials -- in which every citizen has a soapbox -- personal rhetoric remains a vitaltool of expressive survival. This book revives the classical strategies of ancient Greek andRoman rhetoricians and adapts them to the needs of contemporary writers and speakerswho want to improve their persuasive skills. It shows that rhetoric, as it was practiced andtaught by the ancients, was an intrinsic part of daily life and communal discourse aboutcurrent events. This is a fresh interpretation of the ancient canon of composing: invention, arrangement, style, memory, and delivery. The authors&#39;engaging discussion and their many contemporary examples of ancient rhetorical principlespresent rhetoric as a set of flexible, situational practices. The new edition discusses morethoroughly the relevance of classical commonplaces to American political ideologies. Abrief history of ancient rhetorics provides an interesting background for readers. A chapteron memory includes advice for strengthening memory, and a chapter on delivery addressespage design and layout as well as electronic delivery systems such as e-mail and websites. A bibliography and glossary of terms provide additional resources and furtherexplanations. Educators, writers, speakers, and anyone interested in a contemporary translation of ancient rhetorics.</p><p></p><h2>New Hampshire&#39;s Child: Derry Journals of Lesley Frost</h2><p>Here reproduced in facsimile and made available for the first time, these journals have a charming literary quality which would delight the reader even if Lesley&#39;s father had not later become a distinguished American poet.</p><p></p><h2>Clinical Interviewing, with Video Resource Center</h2><p><p><b>The classic guide to proven, practical strategies for conducting effective interviews</b></p> <p><i>Clinical Interviewing, Fifth Edition </i>blends a personal and easy-to-read style with a unique emphasis on both the scientific basis and interpersonal aspects of mental health interviewing.

Their struggle, seemingly to the death, was to leave many readers desolate at the loss of Holmes, but was also to lead to his immortality as a literary figure.</p><p><b>Penzler Pick, February 2000</b>: What is there about the greatest series of short stories in the history of the world that hasn't already been said? This is the second (of five) story collections by Doyle about the greatest detective in literature--and a splendid volume it is, containing such superb puzzles as "The Greek Interpreter," in which readers are introduced to Mycroft Holmes; "The Musgrave Ritual"; "Silver Blaze"; and the earth-shattering "The Final Adventure," recounting the struggle between Holmes and the evil Professor Moriarty in which the two titans were apparently killed as they went over the edge of the Reichenbach Falls. <p> But every mystery reader already knows this. I'm pointing out this marvelous book because it has been extensively annotated by a fine Sherlockian scholar, Les Klinger, who has brought to all serious students of the Holmesian canon a level of erudition seldom encountered. In addition to the expected illustrations from <i>The Strand</i> magazine and meticulous scrutiny of chronological evidence of various events, there are references to primary sources and a staggering helping of information from the thousands of works about Sherlock Holmes by others. </p><p>More than 30 years ago, another great Sherlockian scholar, William S. Baring-Gould, produced a ground-breaking volume that enjoyed more than 35 printings in its original two-volume format and probably sold just as many copies in a slightly less elaborate one-volume size. <i>The Annotated Sherlock Holmes</i> became the single most essential volume in the library of any true Sherlockian, of which the world has far more than you think.</p><p> Les Klinger has acknowledged Baring-Gould in every way imaginable, and it was an act of extraordinary courage to attempt to supercede that monumental work. But that is exactly what he appears to be doing. The first volume, his annotated edition of <i>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</i>, was introduced by the same publisher last year.

As U.S. mining interests and white settlement to the north in Montana Territory increased, conflict arose between the United States and the Lakota and Cheyenne nations. On December 21, 1866, the struggle climaxed when a well-organized force of Lakota, Northern Cheyennes, and Arapahos attacked and destroyed a detachment of forty-nine infantrymen and three officers of the 18th Infantry, twenty-seven troopers of the 2nd Cavalry, and two civilians under the command of Captain William Judd Fetterman near Fort Phil Kearny. The Battle of Where a Hundred Soldiers Were Killed or Hundred in the Hand, as the event is still called, was the worst defeat the U.S. Army had suffered in the Great Plains, only to be exceeded by the Battle of Little Big Horn a decade later.</p><p>Because none of the soldiers lived to tell what happened, the Fetterman fight has fostered a body of myth and speculation. In this study, John H. Monnett provides a groundbreaking examination of the conflicts that ensued in the Powder River Country during the nineteenth century and clarifies events and personalities that have become distorted in the annals of Western history. Monnett examines military interests as well as the geopolitical importance of the area and takes into account the environmental history of the conflict as it relates to hunting ranges, vital wood and water resources, and access to trade avenues.</p></p><p>Monnett takes a closer look at the struggle between the mining interests of the United States and the Lakota and Cheyenne nations in 1866 that climaxed with the Fetterman Massacre.John H. Monnett is a professor of Native American history at the Metropolitan State College of Denver. He is the author of several books, including <i>Massacre at Cheyenne Hole: Lieutenant Austin Henely and the Sappa Creek Controversy</i> and <i>Tell Them We Are Going Home: The Odyssey of the Northern Cheyennes</i>.</p><h2>Mighty Stories Dangerous Rituals</h2><p>Bringing together two of our greatest sources of meaning and transformation<br> <br> This book marries two partners that are made for each other. The result, as in all good unions, is mutual enrichment and deeper life.<br> --Jack Shea, author of Stories of God<br> <br> Now available in paperback, this moving and enlightening book presents us with a compelling vision of what can happen when we take the opportunity to connect stories and rituals--a vision of individuals and communities transformed through a deeper sense of connection to our loved ones, our communities, and God. Herbert Anderson and Edward Foley reveal how when stories and rituals work together, they have the potential to be both mighty and dangerous--mighty in their ability to lift us up and help us make these connections beyond ourselves and dangerous in challenging us to learn to live with complexity and contradiction.<br> <br> They show how much more meaningful a baptism, wedding, or funeral can be when liturgy is made to include and recognize the personal stories of those involved. Suddenly, these familiar life-cycle rituals are infused with new life as their participants become connected in a narrative web linking past and present, human and divine. Newly created rituals can also help us connect our stories to the divine story, giving meaning to what we experience and bringing us closer to God. <br> <br> Ministers, worship leaders, and pastoral caregivers can use this approach to storytelling and ritual to find ways to bring together worship and pastoral care, diminishing fragmentation and fostering coherence in their religious communities.</p><p>How can we bring together two of our most powerful vehicles for communication and transformation?Storytelling and ritual making are not merely something that humans do-they are essential for becoming human. Together they enable us to create a world that is both habitable and hospitable. For believers, they are the fundamental means for shaping and sustaining our journey into the Divine.

He has been working with children in their inner-city schools for more than 40 years.Chapter One <br>A Life Among Schoolchildren<br><br>Dear Francesca, <br>I was very happy that you wrote to me and I apologize for taking two weeks to reply. I was visiting schools in other cities in the first part of the month and I didn&#x2019;t have a chance to read your letter carefully until tonight. <br><br>The answer to your question is that I would love to come and visit in your classroom and I&#x2019;m glad that you invited me. I&#x2019;d also like to reassure you that you didn&#x2019;t need to worry that I&#x2019;d think your letter was presumptuous. I like to hear from teachers and, as you have probably suspected, I feel very close to quite a few of them, especially the ones who work with little children in the elementary grades, because those are the grades I used to teach. I think that teaching is a beautiful profession and that teachers of young children do one of the best things that there is to do in life: bring joy and beauty, mystery and mischievous delight into the hearts of little people in their years of greatest curiosity. <br><br>Sometimes when I&#x2019;m visiting a school, a teacher whom I may have met once when she was in college, or with whom I may have corresponded briefly, or a teacher whom I&#x2019;ve never met but who&#x2019;s read one of my books and feels as if she knows me, sees me standing in the corridor and comes right up and tells me, &#x201c;Come and visit in my classroom!&#x201d; Sometimes she doesn&#x2019;t give me any choice. She simply grabs me by the arm and brings me to the classroom. Then, when I get there, typically she puts me on the spot and asks if I would like to teach a lesson or ask questions to her children. <br><br>I love it when teachers let me do this, but I almost always do it wrong at first, because it&#x2019;s been a long time since I was a teacher, and I often ask the kind of question that gets everybody jumping from their seats and speaking out at the same time. Six-year-olds, when they become excited, as you put it in your letter, have &#x201c;only a theoretical connection with their chairs.&#x201d; They do the most remarkable gymnastics to be sure you see them. A little girl sitting right in front of me will wave her fingers in my face, climbing halfway out of her chair, as if she&#x2019;s going to poke me in the eyes if I won&#x2019;t call on her, and making the most heartrending sounds&#x2014;&#x201c;Ooooh! Ooooh! Ooooh! Ooooh!&#x201d;&#x2014;in case I still don&#x2019;t notice that she&#x2019;s there. Then, when I finally call on her, more often than not she forgets the question that I asked, looks up at me in sweet bewilderment, and asks me, &#x201c;What?&#x201d; It turns out she didn&#x2019;t have a thing to say. She just wanted me to recognize that she was there. <br><br>The teacher usually has to bail me out. She folds her arms and gives the class one of those looks that certain teachers do so well, and suddenly decorum is restored. <br><br>It&#x2019;s a humbling experience, but I think that it&#x2019;s a good one too, for someone who writes books on education to come back into the classroom and stand up there as the teacher does day after day and be reminded in this way of what it&#x2019;s like to do the real work of a teacher. I sometimes think that every education writer, every would-be education expert, and every politician who pontificates, as many do so condescendingly, about the &#x201c;failings&#x201d; of the teachers in the front lines of our nation&#x2019;s public schools ought to be obliged to come into a classroom once a year and teach the class, not just for an hour with the TV cameras watching but for an entire day, and find out what it&#x2019;s like. It might at least impart some moderation to the disrespectful tone with which so many politicians speak of teachers. <br><br>In my writings through the course of nearly 40 years, I have always tried to bring the mighty and ferocious educational debates that dominate the pages of the press and academic publications, in which the voices of our teachers are too seldom heard, back from the distant kingdom of intimidation and abstraction&#x2014;lists of &#x201c;mandates,&#x201d; &#x201c;sanctions,&#x201d; and &#x201c;incentives&#x201d; and &#x201c;performance standards&#x201d; and the rest &#x2014;into the smaller, more specific world of colored crayons, chalk erasers, pencil sharpeners, and tiny quarrels, sometimes tears and sometimes uncontrollably contagious jubilation of which daily life for a real teacher and her students is, in fact, composed. <br><br>I&#x2019;m often disappointed, when I visit some of the allegedly sophisticated schools of education, to recognize how very little of the magic and the incandescent chemistry that forms between a truly gifted teacher and her children is conveyed to those who are about to come into our classrooms. Many of these schools of education have been taken over, to a troubling degree, by people who have little knowledge of the classroom but are the technicians of a dry and mechanistic, often business-driven version of &#x201c;proficiency and productivity.&#x201d; State accountability requirements, correlated closely with the needs and wishes of the corporate community, increasingly control the ethos and the aims of education that are offered to the students at some of these schools. <br><br>But teachers, and especially the teachers of young children, are not servants of the global corporations or drill sergeants for the state and should never be compelled to view themselves that way. I think they have a higher destiny than that. The best of teachers are not merely the technicians of proficiency; they are also ministers of innocence, practitioners of tender expectations. They stalwartly refuse to see their pupils as so many future economic units for a corporate society, little pint-sized deficits or assets for America&#x2019;s economy, into whom they are expected to pump &#x201c;added value,&#x201d; as the pundits of the education policy arena now declaim. Teachers like these believe that every child who has been entrusted to their care comes into their classroom with <i>inherent</i> value to begin with. <br><br>Many of the productivity and numbers specialists who have rigidified and codified school policy in recent years do not seem to recognize much preexisting value in the young mentalities of children and, in particular, in children of the poor. Few of these people seem to be acquainted closely with the lives of children and, to be as blunt as possible about this, many would be dreadful teachers because, in my own experience at least, they tend to be rather grim-natured people who do not have lovable or interesting personalities and, frankly, would not be much fun for kids to be with. <br><br>A bullying tone often creeps into their way of speaking. A cocksure overconfidence, what Erik Erikson described as &#x201c;a destructive conscientiousness,&#x201d; is not unfamiliar too. The longer they remain within their institutes of policy or their positions in the government, the less they seem to have a vivid memory of children&#x2019;s minuscule realities, their squirmy bodies and their vulnerable temperaments, their broken pencil points, their upturned faces when the teacher comes and leans down by their desk to see why they are crying. <br><br>I suspect that you and I will come back to this matter many times. For now I simply want to say I&#x2019;m very, very glad you&#x2019;re teaching here in Boston, because that means that I can visit sometimes in your class without needing to make plans long in advance. Thank you for saying it&#x2019;s okay if I stop by one day without much prior warning, which makes things a whole lot easier for me. As you know, you&#x2019;re teaching in the neighborhood where I began to teach, so I definitely will not need to ask you for directions! <br><br>I promise to visit as soon as I can. Meanwhile, I hope the next few weeks are not too intimidating for you. You said you like your principal and that she&#x2019;s been kind to you. That&#x2019;s one big victory to start with. I&#x2019;m sure there will be many more during the weeks ahead. In spite of the butterflies you said are making &#x201c;many, many loop-the- loops&#x201d; within your stomach almost every morning as you head for school, try hard to enjoy this first month with your children if you can. <br><br>It will someday be a precious memory.<br>Chapter Two <br>Establishing the Chemistry:First Days in the Classroom <br><br>Dear Francesca, <br>You asked me how I felt the first day I ever taught in a public school. <br><br>The truthful answer is that I was terrified, even more than you were, I suspect, because I&#x2019;d had no preparation as a teacher. I had gone to Harvard College, where I was a literature major, then had studied briefly as a Rhodes Scholar in England and had lived in Paris, where I&#x2019;d studied writing in the company of older writers who were living there. <br><br>When I came back to the United States in 1964 and decided I would like to teach in public school, I knew nothing about teaching and had never had a class in education. But my lack of qualifications didn&#x2019;t seem to matter to officials in the Boston Public Schools, who were so desperate to hire almost anyone who would agree to teach in one of Boston&#x2019;s poorest neighborhoods that my application was approved without much questioning. <br><br>I found myself, within three weeks, assigned to teach a fourth grade class in Roxbury, the section of the city where the black community of Boston was confined to live, a pattern of confinement, as you&#x2019;ve noted, that exists unaltered to the present day. <br><br>My school was in a ghostly looking, badly overcrowded and physically decrepit building where my students couldn&#x2019;t even be provided with a classroom of their own. We had to share an undivided auditorium with 35 other children in another fourth grade class, and with a choral group, and sewing class (fifth grade girls, all black, were taken out of academic classes for an hour every day to learn to sew on old machines like those my grandmothers had used), and with a group rehearsing almost all fall for a Christmas play that somehow never was produced. <br></p><h2>Across The River And Into The Trees</h2><p><b>HEMINGWAY'S POIGNANT TALE OF A LOVE FOUND TOO LATE</b> <br> Set in Venice at the close of World War II, <i>Across the River and into the Trees</i> is the bittersweet story of a middle-aged American colonel, scarred by war and in failing health, who finds love with a young Italian countess at the very moment when his life is becoming a physical hardship to him. It is a love so overpowering and spontaneous that it revitalizes the man's spirit and encourages him to dream of a future, even though he knows that there can be no hope for long. Spanning a matter of hours, <i>Across the River and into the Trees</i> is tender and moving, yet tragic in the inexorable shadow of what must come.</p><p>Ernest Hemingway did more to influence the style of English prose than any other writer of his time. Publication of&nbsp;<i>The Sun Also Rises</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>A Farewell to Arms</i>&nbsp;immediately established him as one of the greatest literary lights of the 20th century. His classic novella&nbsp;<i>The Old Man and the Sea&nbsp;</i>won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953. Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954. He died in 1961.<b>Chapter One</b><br><br>They started two hours before daylight, and at first, it was not necessary to break the ice across the canal as other boats had gone on ahead. In each boat, in the darkness, so you could not see, but only hear him, the poler stood in the stern, with his long oar. The shooter sat on a shooting stool fastened to the top of a box that contained his lunch and shells, and the shooter's two, or more, guns were propped against the load of wooden decoys. Somewhere, in each boat, there was a sack with one or two live mallard hens, or a hen and a drake, and in each boat there was a dog who shifted and shivered uneasily at the sound of the wings of the ducks that passed overhead in the darkness.<br><br>Four of the boats went on up the main canal toward the big lagoon to the north. A fifth boat had already turned off into a side canal. Now, the sixth boat turned south into a shallow lagoon, and there was no broken water.<br><br>It was all ice, new-frozen during the sudden, windless cold of the night. It was rubbery and bending against the thrust of the boatman's oar. Then it would break as sharply as a pane of glass, but the boat made little forward progress.<br><br>"Give me an oar," the shooter in the sixth boat said. He stood up and braced himself carefully. He could hear the ducks passing in the darkness, and feel the restless lurching of the dog. To the north he heard the sound of breaking ice from the other boats.<br><br>"Be careful," the poler in the stern said. "Don't tip the boat over."<br><br>"I am a boatman, too," the shooter said.<br><br>He took the long oar the boatman handed him and reversed it so he could hold it by the blade. Holding the blade he reached forward and punched the handle through the ice. He felt the firm bottom of the shallow lagoon, put his weight on the top of the wide oar-blade, and holding with both hands and, first pulling, then shoving, until the pole-hold was well to the stern, he drove the boat ahead to break the ice. The ice broke like sheets of plate glass as the boat drove into it, and onto it, and astern the boatman shoved them ahead into the broken passage.<br><br>After a while, the shooter, who was working hard and steadily and sweating in his heavy clothes, asked the boatman, "Where is the shooting barrel?"<br><br>"Off there to the left. In the middle of the next bay."<br><br>"Should I turn for it now?"<br><br>"As you wish."<br><br>"What do you mean, as I wish? You know the water. Is there water to carry us there?"<br><br>"The tide is low. Who knows?"<br><br>"It will be daylight before we get there if we don't hurry."<br><br>The boatman did not answer.<br><br>All right, you surly jerk, the shooter thought to himself. We are going to get there. We've made two-thirds of the way now and if you are worried about having to work to break ice to pick up birds, that is altogether too bad.<br><br>"Get your back in it, jerk," he said in English.<br><br>"What?" the boatman asked in Italian.<br><br>"I said let's go. It's going to be light."<br><br>It was daylight before they reached the oaken staved hogshead sunk in the bottom of the lagoon. It was surrounded by a sloping rim of earth that had been planted with sedge and grass, and the shooter swung carefully up onto this, feeling the frozen grasses break as he stepped on them. The boatman lifted the combination shooting stool and shell box out of the boat and handed it to the shooter, who leaned over and placed it in the bottom of the big barrel.<br><br>The shooter, wearing his hip boots and an old combat jacket, with a patch on the left shoulder that no one understood, and with the slight light places on the straps, where stars had been removed, climbed down into the barrel and the boatman handed him his two guns.<br><br>He placed them against the wall of the barrel and hung his other shell bag between them, hanging it on two hooks built into the wall of the sunken barrel. Then he leaned the guns against each side of the shell bag.<br><br>"Is there water?" he asked the boatman.<br><br>"No water," the boatman said.<br><br>"Can you drink the lagoon water?"<br><br>"No. It is unhealthy."<br><br>The shooter was thirsty from the hard work of breaking the ice and driving the boat in and he felt his anger rise, and then held it, and said, "Can I help you in the boat to break ice to put out the decoys?"<br><br>"No," the boatman said and shoved the boat savagely out onto the thin sheet ice that cracked and ripped as the boat drove up onto it. The boatman commenced smashing at the ice with the blade of his oar and then started tossing decoys out to the side and behind him.<br><br>He's in a beautiful mood, the shooter thought. He's a big brute, too. I worked like a horse coming out here. He just pulled his weight and that's all. What the hell is eating him? This is his trade isn't it?<br><br>He arranged the shooting stool so he would have the maximum swing to left and right, opened a box of shells, and filled his pockets and opened another of the boxes of shells in the shell bag so he could reach into it easily. In front of him, where the lagoon lay glazed in the first light, was the black boat and the tall, heavily built boatman smashing with his oar at the ice and tossing decoys overboard as though he were ridding himself of something obscene.<br><br>It was getting lighter now and the shooter could see the low line of the near point across the lagoon. Beyond that point he knew there were two other shooting posts and far beyond it there was more marsh and then the open sea. He loaded both his guns and checked the position of the boat that was putting out decoys.<br><br>From behind him, he heard the incoming whisper of wings and he crouched, took hold of his right hand gun with his right hand as he looked up from under the rim of the barrel, then stood to shoot at the two ducks that were dropping down, their wings set to brake, coming down dark in the gray dim sky, slanting toward the decoys.<br><br>His head low, he swung the gun on a long slant, down, well and ahead of the second duck, then without looking at the result of his shot he raised the gun smoothly, up, up ahead and to the left of the other duck that was climbing to the left and as he pulled, saw it fold in flight and drop among the decoys in the broken ice. He looked to his right and saw the first duck a black patch on the same ice. He knew he had shot carefully on the first duck, far to the right of where the boat was, and on the second, high out and to the left, letting the duck climb far up and to the left to be sure the boat was out of any line of fire. It was a lovely double, shot exactly as he should have shot, with complete consideration and respect for the position of the boat, and he felt very good as he reloaded.<br><br>"Listen," the man in the boat called. "Don't shoot toward the boat."<br><br>I'll be a sad son of a bitch, the shooter said to himself. I will indeed.<br><br>"Get your decoys out," he called to the man in the boat. "But get them out fast. I won't shoot until they are all out. Except straight overhead."<br><br>The man in the boat said nothing that could be heard.<br><br>I can't figure it, the shooter thought to himself. He knows the game. He knows I split the work, or more, coming out. I never shot a safer or more careful duck in my life than that. What's the matter with him? I offered to put the dekes out with him. The hell with him.<br><br>Out on the right now, the boatman was still chopping angrily at the ice, and tossing out the wooden decoys in a hatred that showed in every move he made.<br><br>Don't let him spoil it, the shooter told himself. There won't be much shooting with this ice unless the sun should melt it later on. You probably will only have a few birds, so don't let him spoil it for you. You don't know how many more times you will shoot ducks and do not let anything spoil it for you.<br><br>He watched the sky lightening beyond the long point of marsh, and turning in the sunken barrel, he looked out across the frozen lagoon, and the marsh, and saw the snow-covered mountains a long way off. Low as he was, no foothills showed, and the mountains rose abruptly from the plain. As he looked toward the mountains he could feel a breeze on his face and he knew, then, the wind would come from there, rising with the sun, and that some birds would surely come flying in from the sea when the wind disturbed them.<br><br>The boatman had finished putting out the decoys. They were in two bunches, one straight ahead and to the left toward where the sun would rise, and the other to the shooter's right. Now he dropped over the hen mallard with her string and anchor, and the calling duck bobbed her head under water, and raising and dipping her head, splashed water onto her back.<br><br>"Don't you think it would be good to break more ice around the edges?" the shooter called to the boatman. "There's not much water to attract them."<br><br>The boatman said nothing but commenced to smash at the jagged perimeter of ice with his oar. This ice breaking was unnecessary and the boatman knew it. But the shooter did not know it and he thought, I do not understand him but I must not let him ruin it. I must keep it entire and not let him do it. Every time you shoot now can be the last shoot and no stupid son of a bitch should be allowed to ruin it. Keep your temper, boy, he told himself.<br><br>Copyright � 1950 by Ernest Hemmingway<br><br>Copyright renewed � 1978 by Mary Hemmingway</p><h2>Greek Tragedies, Volume 3</h2><p>In three paperback volumes, the Grene and Lattimore editions offer a selection of the most important and characteristic plays of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides from the nine-volume anthology of <i>The Complete Greek Tragedies</i>.

Options allow you to reap the same benefits as an outright stock or commodity trade, but with less risk and less money on the line. The truth is, you can achieve everything with options that you would with stocks or commodities?at less cost?while gaining a much higher percentage return on your invested dollars. <p>After numerous years as a market maker in the trenches of the New York Mercantile Exchange, few analysts know how to make money trading options like author Lee Lowell. In this well-rounded resource, Lowell shows both stock and commodity option traders exactly what works and what doesn't.</p> <p>Filled with in-depth insight and expert advice, <i>Get Rich with Options</i> provides you with the knowledge and strategies needed to achieve optimal results within the options market. The book quickly covers the basics?how options are priced, strike price selection, the use of Delta, and using volatility to one's advantage?before moving on to the four options trading strategies that have helped Lowell profit in this arena time and again: buying deep-in-the-money call options, selling naked puts, selling option credit spreads, and selling covered calls. Using these strategoes decisively, he says, is the fastest route to riches in the options trading game.</p> <p><i>Get Rich with Options</i> is packed with real-life examples of actual trades and detailed discussions of how options can be used as a hedging, speculating, or income-producing tool. You'll learn how to set up a home business with the best options trading software, tools, and Web sites. And you'll begin to see options in a whole new light and discover how to become part of a small group of investors who consistently win.</p></p><p><b>Praise for <i>Get Rich with Options</i></b> <p>"No more excuses! <i>Get Rich with Options</i> provides a clear, honest, and detailed picture of the potential to trade stock and commodity options successfully. Lee covers all the bases, starting with the basics then spending time on concepts such as ITM, OTM, ATM, volatility, spreads, and delta.

Get Rich with Options is the perfect segue into the world of options trading for anyone who has been intrigued by this investment strategy but too intimidated to try it. For the more seasoned trader, Lee offers little-known tips and advice that have kept him ahead of the pack for years. This is a rare how-to guide that answers all the questions, gives step-by-step instructions, and should be on every options trader's bookshelf."<br> &#x2014;Margaret Beeler, Managing Director, International Strategy &amp; Investment, Inc.</p> <p>"There are many options books in the market today. For the most part, they impart sterile options strategies that will 'theoretically' work for you. But, they are written from the perspective of an academic. In Lee Lowell's <i>Get Rich with Options</i>, you will learn options and commodities basics. That's not where the value is. The value of this outstanding, understandable book comes from the author's perspective of how to trade options and commodities. Lee Lowell brings you the secrets from the trading pits in New York, the secrets of a market-maker, a trader who MUST make money to survive, a trader who has made thousands of successful trades.

Clear your shelf for this one, it is an invaluable guide for the fastest growing segment of the investment arena today."<br> &#x2014;Karim Rahemtulla, Chairman, Mt.

One of Thorne Smith's best-loved comedies, it proves once again that he is the undisputed master of urbane wit and sophisticated repartee.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cosmo Topper, the mild-mannered bank manager who was persuaded to take a walk on the wild side by the ghosts of George and Marion Kerby in Topper, finds himself reunited with his dyspeptic wife for an extended vacation on the Riviera. But he doesn't have long to enjoy the peace and quiet before the irrepressible Kerbys materialize once again and start causing fracases, confusing the citizenry, alarming the gendarmes, getting naked, and turning every occasion into revelry or melee. Soon Marion decides that Topper as a ghost would be even more laughs than Topper in the flesh. And all she needs to arrange is one simple little murder.<br><br>Born in Annapolis, Maryland, in 1892, educated at Dartmouth, THORNE SMITH was an early cohort of Dorothy Parker's.

A magnificent spectacle, that--Topper and the Mediterranean. Kindred spirits well met, contemplating each other across an alluring girdle of sand.<br><br>Not a large man, Topper--Cosmo Topper. Nor yet a small man. Certainly not a small. A comfortable man, rather. Slightly plump, if anything, and clad in a pair of blue silk pajamas. And there was the Mediterranean just as it had been there for a considerable length of time--much&nbsp;&nbsp;longer than Mr. Topper, for one thing. A vast expanse of cool ocean as blue and virginal seeming as the garments adorning the figure then inspecting it from the balcon of a discouragingly pale stucco villa set in a garden fairly bristling with grass of a repellent toughness--grass so hostilely tough that only a rhinoceros could sit on it with any showing of dignity and aplomb. Unfortunately, as rhinoceroses are rarely if ever encountered in these drab days sitting on Riviera grass in Riviera gardens, this observation must of necessity remain merely one of those vast mental pictures upon which to dwell during the interminable reaches of a family reunion.<br><br>On this early morning, one which appeared about as willing to give as to receive of the good things of life, Mr. Topper had the Mediterranean very much to himself. In fact, he was quite alone with all that great quantity of water.<br><br>There was the man. And there was the ocean. Unique and distinct. One might even choose between them, if suddenly faced with such a disagreeable necessity. However, so splendidly did they go together, so well matched or mated were the two, that most persons of discrimination would have hesitated to separate them. They would have preferred to sidestep the issue and to retain both Topper and the Mediterranean intact. But, of course, there are some who might have wanted the ocean more than the man, or vice versa. Who can say?<br><br>We are fortunate in being able to have them both at their best, Topper on his balcon, and the Mediterranean in its bed.<br><br>Across the Mediterranean Mr. Topper cast an early morning look, and the Mediterranean graciously offered its full-bosomed amplitude to his inspection. And although it has been previously observed that both were of a virginal blueness, it should not be forgotten that either one of them was capable of pulling some powerfully rough stuff when the opportunity offered.<br><br>Topper, it is to be learned with some relief, was virginal more through circumstance than choice. This does not imply that his was a low and lecherous nature. Nor does it necessarily follow that he was epicurean in such matters. But he did like things nice that way. Most men do, when and if possible.<br><br>Topper had been a banker by profession. He still was a husband--an original error of judgment unrectified by time. Habit is a dreadful thing. Once he had commuted without realizing the error of his ways. Most men commute through necessity. Topper had done so ritualistically. In Glendale, U. S. A., the Toppers had been socially solid. All that had changed, but not through Mrs. Topper.<br><br>The fact is that rather late in the day Cosmo Topper had been subjected to the ultra violent rays of a series of amorous and disreputable adventures as incredible as they had been entertaining. These adventures had left his pulse still beating in perfect harmony with the more enjoyable if less laudable preoccupations of life. They had not so much changed his character as ventilated it, given it a chance to breathe good, honest vulgar air vitalized by the fumes of grog. As a result, he had succeeded in washing his hands of work, but figuratively women still clung to them. There were times when those hands of Topper's fairly itched after women, which is the natural state of all healthy and enterprising masculine hands.<br><br>Even now, in the innocent face of this clean Riviera morning, the man was actually speculating as to the exact degree of nudity the German model would achieve on the beach a few hours hence. Yesterday, to his almost visible agitation, this lady of wolfish lines had reached what he had every reason to believe to be the absolute limit of anatomical candour. In spite of this awe-inspiring display, something told Topper that this German model, in her relentless quest of a coat of tan, still held a few more cubic inches in reserve which she would willingly sacrifice to the sun. Until she did this there was no peace of mind for any inquiring spirit on the beach. And when this greatly to be desired end had been attained, Topper both hoped and proposed to be stationed critically in the front ranks of a vast, admiring, and cosmopolitan multitude. He owed himself that much. Not that he lusted after the woman, but too long and too patiently had he attended in clinical expectancy to be, at the end, deprived of this point of vantage.<br><br>Once she had definitely and conclusively arrived at the climax of her revelations, Topper felt that he would be quite willing to call it a game. He had no desire to pursue his investigations further. All suspense would be at an end. The German model could go her way, while he would go his as if the incident had never occurred. Her crisply burned body would remain in his memory merely as a remarkable phenomenon, something to wonder about, like a landslide, subway rush, or Democratic Convention.<br><br>However, until that time Mr. Topper's interests were very much involved. True enough, so gradually had the German model progressed on her way to nudity that much of the shock had evaporated before fresh territory was opened up for inspection, but by the same token, the very deliberateness of the method employed lent to the business an atmosphere of terrific suspense. What the morrow would bring forth, or, rather, off, was the anxious speculation in scores of masculine minds. Women also wondered. Topper suspected several depraved frequenters of the Casino actually of betting on the results of the model's daily progress. For example, the fifth rib against the diaphragm, heavy odds against a complete torso.<br>Being bored abroad is one of America's favorite customs. And not without reason.<br>Mr. Topper held stoutly to the belief that within the short space of several weeks this German model had done more to establish friendly relations--to create a sort of entente intime, in fact--between her country and the Allied Powers than had been achieved by all the diplomatic gestures and disarmament conferences that had supplied the public with dull reading since the Armistice.<br><br>"And not a bad idea," he mused, yawning. "In fact, a splendid idea. Instead of holding a series of silly disarmament conferences at which everyone gets all hot and bothered and cables home to hurry up with more guns--instead of this, why not institute a set of disrobing conferences? Why not make a clean breast of it internationally? Let us strip ourselves of our all and face each other man to woman instead of man to man. No more beating about the bush or dangerous secret diplomacy. No more old men telling lies to other old men. At innumerable private conferences the idea has worked out not only successfully but entertainingly. Why not try it out on a large international scale?"<br><br>He considered his Mediterranean now as if in a trance. Topper was seeing in his mind's eye the American ambassador to England clad only in a pipe, looking at the German delegate trying to face the world in glasses. He saw a famous old French bargain hunter smilingly surveying the scene protected only by a blue b�ret--tr�s gentil. And a gentleman from Italy clad only in a neat but shrunken black shirt--what a sight! Mahatma Ghandi taking everything quite naturally, together with a few grains of rice. Then there would be the ladies, supplied probably by an international theatrical committee: Miss America, Mlle France, Se�orita Madrid, et al. Altogether a jolly party. A conference that would accomplish some results, at least, no matter what those results might be. Agreeable events would be sure to occur.<br><br>The Mediterranean invites the idle mind to do some very curious thinking, and Mr. Topper, it seems, had accepted the invitation. And all the while these and other equally unbecoming thoughts were corroding the mind of this erstwhile banker, within the pale villa, his wife was sleeping most unpicturesquely yet most thoroughly. In spite of the many sterling qualities of this really admirable lady, one could forgive without too great a struggle her husband for preferring to think of the German model.<br><br>There was so much of her worth thinking about and so many choice bits of that so much. And strange to relate, Topper had not the faintest conception of what she looked like--no idea at all of her face. Men are like that. Careless. Just grown-up boys with a few extra tricks tacked on.<br><br>He well remembered the day when she had first made her appearance on the beach. Like many successful men and women before her, she had made rather modest and cautious beginnings. Only a scant couple of yards of her were exposed to the avid caress of the sun that day. From that first casual view of her one never would have suspected that there was so very much more of the German model still left unseen. Yet as time went on and vaster expanses became exposed, one came to believe that perhaps this German model would never cease, but like the brook continue on forever. Now, most fortunately for everyone concerned, there was little left of the lady that remained unexposed. With characteristic Teutonic system and thoroughness she had succeeded in revolutionizing the color of her skin and at the same time hanging up a record for plain and fancy nudity on a beach where such a record was exceedingly hard to make.<br><br>She was a good influence, Mr. Topper decided, as he stood on his balcon, getting himself together for the day. She was the living symbol of one of the few interests that nations held in common. She drew men together, took their mind off grimmer if higher things. Furthermore, she didn't give a dam...</p><h2>No Ordinary Disruption: The Four Global Forces Breaking All the Trends</h2><p>Our intuition on how the world works could well be wrong. We are surprised when new competitors burst on the scene, or businesses protected by large and deep moats find their defenses easily breached, or vast new markets are conjured from nothing. Trend lines resemble saw-tooth mountain ridges.<br><br>The world not only feels different. The data tell us it is different. Based on years of research by the directors of the McKinsey Global Institute, <i>No Ordinary Disruption: The Four Forces Breaking all the Trends</i> is a timely and important analysis of how we need to reset our intuition as a result of four forces colliding and transforming the global economy: the rise of emerging markets, the accelerating impact of technology on the natural forces of market competition, an aging world population, and accelerating flows of trade, capital and people.<br><br>Our intuitions formed during a uniquely benign period for the world economy&#x2014;often termed the Great Moderation. Asset prices were rising, cost of capital was falling, labour and resources were abundant, and generation after generation was growing up more prosperous than their parents.<br><br>But the Great Moderation has gone. The cost of capital may rise. The price of everything from grain to steel may become more volatile. The world's labor force could shrink. Individuals, particularly those with low job skills, are at risk of growing up poorer than their parents.<br><br>What sets No Ordinary Disruption apart is depth of analysis combined with lively writing informed by surprising, memorable insights that enable us to quickly grasp the disruptive forces at work.

Despite the hegemony of central projection, or perspective, other equally important methods of representation have much to tell us. Parallel projection can be found on classical Greek vases, in Pompeiian frescoes, in Byzantine mosaics; it returned in works of the historical avant-garde, and remains the dominant form of representation in China. In <i>Oblique Drawing</i>, Massimo Scolari investigates &#x201c;anti-perspective&#x201d; visual representation over two thousand years, finding in the course of his investigation that visual and conceptual representations are manifestations of the ideological and philosophical orientations of different cultures. Images prove to be not just a form of art but a form of thought, a projection of a way of life.</p><p>Scolari's generously illustrated studies show that illusionistic perspective is not the only, or even the best, representation of objects in history; parallel projection, for example, preserves in scale the actual measurements of objects it represents, avoiding the distortions of one-point perspective. Scolari analyzes the use of nonperspectival representations in pre-Renaissance images of machines and military hardware, architectural models and drawings, and illustrations of geometrical solids. He challenges Panofsky's theory of Pompeiian perspective and explains the difficulties encountered by the Chinese when they viewed Jesuit missionaries' perspectival religious images.</p><p>Scolari vividly demonstrates the diversity of representational forms devised through the centuries, and shows how each one reveals something that is lacking in the others.</p></p><p>Massimo Scolari is a prominent architectural historian. He is also an editor, designer, artist, and pilot. He has taught at the Istituto Universitario di Architettura di Venezia (IUAV), Cornell University, Cooper Union, Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies (IAUS), Technische Universit�t Vienna, Harvard University, and Yale University.<br><br>James S.

His extensive writings include <i>Coming Through the Whirlwind</i>. Dr. Eigen is in the private practice of psychoanalysis in New York City.'This book is a rich phenomenological and psychodynamic exploration of "the mad dimension of life", a discussion which has both breadth and depth. Eigen must certainly rank amongst the foremost of contemporary analytic therapists and theorists who are making significant steps in furthering our understanding of madness. Any clinician who has ever attempted to understand the thoughts and experiences of psychotic patients will find much that is illuminating and well described in this book.'- Phil Mollon in British Journal of Psychiatry'An extraordinary book. Reading The Psychotic Core not only becomes an excursion through the (universal) elements of psychosis, but evolves into an encounter with the psychotic process itself. Eigen is, however, fundamentally a psychoanalyst in his approach and method, and his analytic view constitutes both a framework for interpretation and a mode of knowing. By listening to psychosis, by understanding its presence, by looking at (and interpreting) its symbolizations, we enhance our knowledge of what it means to live in a historical project that finds itself affected by periodic eruptions of a cultural and political madness.'- James M. Glass in The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease'The Psychotic Core is one of the finest treatises I have ever read on the subject. It is solidly clinical and pragmatic on one hand, and yet it is a piece of exquisite, artistic phenomenology on the other. Eigen's concept of madness elegantly spans what we ordinarily mean by borderline states as well as the formal psychotic states. The work is a very creatively integrative one. The pigments on his palette include Freud, Jung, Bion, Winnicott, and many others.'- James Grotstein in Psychotherapy &amp; Social Science Review</p><h2>Respiratory Physiology: The Essentials (Respiratory Physiology: The Essentials (West))</h2><p><p>Widely considered the "gold standard" textbook for respiratory physiology, this compact, concise, and easy-to-read text is now in its fully updated Eighth Edition.

Now more timely and thought-provoking than ever, this esteemed classic of twentieth-century social science examines the deep cultural "frame of mind" that influences work life to this day in northern America and Western Europe. Stephen Kalberg's internationally acclaimed translation captures the essence of Weber's style as well as the subtlety of his descriptions and causal arguments. <br><br>Now, for the first time in one volume, <em>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism with Other Writings on the Rise of the West</em> integrates Weber's exploration of the spirit of capitalism's origins with his larger project: a multi-causal analysis of the West's distinctiveness and its sources. Weber's texts present wide-ranging discussions on the Western city, state, forms of rulership and law, and modes of economic innovation. Moreover, in many selections Weber offers in-depth and insightful comparisons to China and India. Readings on the "economic ethics" of Confucianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Catholicism further illuminate the distinct qualities of the West's trajectory and its diverse causes. A separate section examines the long-range influence of the ascetic Protestant sects and churches on American society.<br><br>To draw readers into the material, this engaging volume includes extended introductions by the editor, many new translations, a chronology of Weber's life, an expanded glossary and bibliography, and numerous clarifying endnotes. In addition, Kalberg addresses a variety of debates concerning the central elements of contemporary life. Ideal for courses in sociology, anthropology, political science, history, international relations, and economics, <em>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism with Other Writings on the Rise of the West</em> is an essential resource for anyone seeking to understand the origins and endurance of the modern West.<br></p><p><br><strong>Stephen Kalberg</strong> is Associate Professor of Sociology at Boston University and an affiliate of the Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies at Harvard University.

Author Thomas E. Skidmore, a preeminent authority on Brazil, provides a lively political and economic narrative while also including relevant details on society and culture. Skidmore's major revision of the colonial chapters begins with the discovery of Brazil by Pedro Alvares Cabral and includes Portugal's remarkable command of the vast country in the face of Spanish, French, and Dutch colonial interests. The text goes on to cover the move of the Portuguese monarchy to Brazil in 1808, the country's independence in 1822, establishment of the Empire within the context of expansion of the coffee trade, the importance of slavery in nineteenth-century Brazil, and the move towards abolition. This second edition offers an unparallelled look at Brazil in the twentieth century, including in-depth coverage of the 1930 revolution and Vargas's rise to power; the ensuing unstable democratic period and the military coups that followed; and the reemergence of democracy in 1985. It concludes with the recent presidency of Luiz Inacio "Lula" da Silva, covering such economic successes as record-setting exports, dramatic foreign debt reduction, and improved income distribution. The second edition features numerous new images and a new bibliographic guide to recent works on Brazilian history for use by both instructors and students.<br> Informed by the most recent scholarship available, <em>Brazil: Five Centuries of Change,</em> Second Edition, explores the country's many blessings--ethnic diversity, racial democracy, a vibrant cultural life, and a wealth of natural resources. It also looks at Brazil's historically severe problems--including political instability, military rule, chronic inflation, and international debt--and its deplorable environmental record. An ideal choice for undergraduate and graduate courses in Latin American history, this eloquent and detailed look at Brazil will be the standard history of the country for years to come.<br></p><p>Europeans first became aware of the huge territory called Brazil as a distant outpost of what the Portuguese conquerors called the <i>Estado de India</i>, a far-flung "network of coastal enclaves running along the Indian Ocean, from Mozambique, around the Malabar coast of India, and all the way to Macao on the coast of China." Thomas Skidmore, a noted historian of Latin America, writes that it quickly emerged as something more, however: a near-fabulous land of opportunity. An early gold rush outside Rio de Janeiro confirmed this view, and Brazil attracted huge numbers of immigrants, so many that the Portuguese crown was forced to limit the number of young men who attempted to leave their native country in favor of the newfound promised land. And, for a time, Skidmore continues, Brazil indeed led the world in the production of gold, diamonds, and other precious gems and minerals, making considerable fortunes for a lucky few. Governmental ineptitude assured that Brazil never translated that wealth into a comfortable life for all its inhabitants, a condition that has endured to the present. Skidmore traces the history of Brazil from the time of the European conquest to the late 1990s, yielding a highly useful one-volume history that students and general readers alike will enjoy. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>Thonmas E.

There is so much to be said about that first day. We&#x2019;re making a first impression and so are the students. I&#x2019;d like to think that I&#x2019;m dispelling their preconceptions and that they are more alert and they&#x2019;re thinking, Oh! This is engaging! You want them to know you care about them.<br> <br>In fact, if someone was absent on that first day, I often told him or her to go ahead and withdraw. That first class was about learning the basics: who they are, who I am, and my rules and expectations. One expectation I always wanted to extinguish was that just showing up to every class meant &#x201c;I get a B or a C.&#x201d; Showing up is the smallest expectation I had for any of them.<br> <br>Key to first impressions is, as we all know, what you wear. That goes for both teachers and students. As a teacher, I felt stronger and more in control if I looked professional. Even in my junior days of teaching, I always wore a tie. It might be a knit tie, and I might have worn jeans with it, but a tie denotes effort. I wanted to feel in command, and dressing up helped me do that.<br> <br>Also key for teachers looking to make a good first impression is to look around the room at the start of every class and fully engage with the students. Opening the class with &#x201c;How are you?&#x201d; is a sensational idea, and so simple. In any group, you don&#x2019;t walk in and start to talk. You shouldn&#x2019;t do that in a classroom, either.<br> <br>I would ask everyone in the class to say their name and something about themselves, and then I would make notes on the roster. I found the students felt more invested if they introduced themselves rather than just saying, &#x201c;Here!&#x201d; They had a responsibility to show up and participate and contribute to the chemistry of the class.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re all on an even playing field,&#x201d; I told my students in my opening remarks. &#x201c;You will distinguish yourself up or down from this point forward. Just being here, that&#x2019;s not enough. You have to fully embrace these assignments and do them exceptionally well. You can&#x2019;t be a cipher. Just because you&#x2019;re present doesn&#x2019;t mean you&#x2019;ll get a good grade.&#x201d;<br> <br>At the end of every class, I would wait until everyone was gone and the next class was coming in, and then I would think, Now I can go. Maybe no one would come up to me after class for weeks on end, but I still never rushed out. Whether or not they took advantage all semester of my availability, I wanted them to know that if they did need me, I was there to hear what they had to say.<br> <br>Every year a couple of students would approach me on that first day and tell me they didn&#x2019;t belong in this class because they had experienced the course&#x2019;s content before and were too advanced. I always said the same thing to them: &#x201c;For the next four weeks we have an add/drop period. If you show during that time that you are capable of higher-level work, we&#x2019;ll advance you to the next level.&#x201d; Did it ever happen? Never.<br> <br>That said, at Parsons you are required to attend classes. You were only permitted two absences, period. The classroom experience is why you&#x2019;re there. &#x201c;I have a doctor&#x2019;s note,&#x201d; a student might say. &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter,&#x201d; I would reply. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve missed this experience. You have four absences. You need to withdraw, or you need to take a leave of absence. You&#x2019;re not going to pass this class. Period.&#x201d;<br> <br>I would make it clear that this class was about nurturing everyone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. up to a point.<br> <br>I would give the students explicit instructions in writing via an extensive syllabus. There always needs to be a syllabus. Teachers who resist having one make me nervous. When I was a department chair, I hosted a syllabus workshop and still found teachers hesitant to commit their teaching philosophies to paper. They were paranoid about sharing. But we needed consistency.<br> <br>When I handed out my course syllabi, I would make the students sign a document saying they&#x2019;d received and, most important, read it. This may sound obnoxious, but it was sadly necessary. Two-thirds of the way through the semester, I would invariably hear, &#x201c;You never told us that!&#x201d; And I then would take out the syllabus and show them that they had signed something saying otherwise.<br> <br>One thing I learned in the course of my teaching career was to never judge anyone on that first day. When I started out, I was smug about having the students&#x2019; characters all figured out at first glance. Oh, that one seems smart! or This one seems not so bright! But students often&#x2014;I would say, usually&#x2014;surprise you. As a young teacher, I misjudged so often that ultimately I stopped judging altogether. It was about reducing my level of frustration. To keep myself from ever uttering the words, &#x201c;I thought you had such promise,&#x201d; I maintained a mantra of, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s wait and see.&#x201d;<br> <br>Often the really articulate, highly participatory students were all talk. To them I often heard myself saying, &#x201c;You said you could do it. Now where is it?&#x201d; If we&#x2019;d only had one meeting, I would have left impressed, but by week three, I would be underwhelmed. My advice to them was, &#x201c;Stop talking so much and get to work.&#x201d; To those who initially struck me as weak but who turned out to be brilliant, I said: &#x201c;Learn how to make a better first impression. Learn how to show off a little.&#x201d;<br> <br>There&#x2019;s no substitute for experience. I have the greatest respect for new teachers&#x2014;their enthusiasm, their eagerness to have a great relationship with their students and to help them learn. At the same time, veteran teachers are great beneficiaries of trial and error. Mistakes are so valuable, providing you learn from them. One of the worst things for a teacher is to be stubborn and rigid.<br> <br>When I began teaching, I erred on being overly kind and generous in my assessment of the students&#x2019; work. I realized by midterm that it wasn&#x2019;t doing them any favors. What I was really doing was lowering the bar of my expectation to where the students actually were. The trouble with that is, they&#x2019;ll stay there. If the teacher&#x2019;s expectations are higher than what the students can achieve, they&#x2019;ll keep pushing themselves. It&#x2019;s like running a marathon alone: You can&#x2019;t gauge where you are. And so, as I became a more seasoned teacher, I resolved to keep the bar higher.<br>&#x201c;My favorite teacher was &#x2018;Doc&#x2019; John Anderson, my political science teacher at Edison High School. I was taken seriously as a school athlete, but no teacher until Doc took me seriously. He paid attention to what I said in class. He showed an interest in me. He uncovered the &#x2018;real&#x2019; Karen. I began to be recognized as a smart kid, not a jock. He meant the world to me. When you are struggling to find yourself, having someone really listen is very important. I graduated with a B.S. in Criminal Justice. I was the first person in my family to get a college degree. Doc gave me the confidence to just go do it. I miss that little guy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x2014;KAREN, FOOD BANK WORKER, NEW JERSEY<br></p><h2>An Inquiry into Modes of Existence: An Anthropology of the Moderns</h2><p><p>In this new book, Bruno Latour offers answers to questions raised in <i>We Have Never Been Modern, </i>a work that interrogated the connections between nature and culture. If not modern, he asked, what <i>have</i> we been, and what values should we inherit? Over the past twenty-five years, Latour has developed a research protocol different from the actor-network theory with which his name is now associated--a research protocol that follows the different types of connectors that provide specific truth conditions. These are the connectors that prompt a climate scientist challenged by a captain of industry to appeal to the <i>institution</i> of science, with its army of researchers and mountains of data, rather than to "capital-S Science" as a higher authority. Such modes of extension--or modes of existence, Latour argues here--account for the many differences between law, science, politics, and other domains of knowledge.</p><p>Though scientific knowledge corresponds to only one of the many possible modes of existence Latour describes, an unrealistic vision of science has become the arbiter of reality and truth, seducing us into judging all values by a single standard. Latour implores us to recover other modes of existence in order to do justice to the plurality of truth conditions that Moderns have discovered throughout their history. This systematic effort of building a new philosophical anthropology presents a completely different view of what Moderns have been, and provides a new basis for opening diplomatic encounters with other societies at a time when all societies are coping with ecological crisis.</p></p><p><p>Bruno Latour is Professor at Sciences Po, Paris, and the 2013 winner of the Ludvig Holberg International Memorial Prize.</p>&#x201c;[<i>An Inquiry into Modes of Existence</i>] is not just a book; it is also a project in <i>interactive metaphysics</i>.

Latour speaks with urgency when he asks us all to set aside the script of secular modernity&#x2015;to stop insulting each other and learn to pluralize, apologize and ecologize.

In his intimate history of those years, Silverman sets out to prove this sweeping conceit by relying on the eyes and ears and memories of the men and women who were <i>there </i>creating that history. Without inhibition, more than 120 of the most notable heads of houses, editors and publishers of this time shared many never-before told stories about how the most important books in postwar America came into being, and are still being read today.</p><p>In <i>The Time of Their Lives</i> we learn how ...</p><p>-- Robert Gottlieb worked with Joseph Heller to make <i>Catch-18, </i>as it was then called, into the world renowned <i>Catch-22...</i></p><p>-- Corlies &#x201c;Cork&#x201d; Smith took a risk on a shy young man he had never&nbsp;&nbsp;heard of, Thomas Pynchon, after being absorbed by one of his earliest short stories ...</p><p>-- Leona Nevler edited under delicate working conditions with a most difficult author, to make <i>Peyton Place </i>a novel for all generations.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was Arthur Thornhill, Sr., in his years as president of Little, Brown&#x2019;s grand publishing house who said about the occupation he loved, &#x201c;I wanted to be part of something that was <i>good,</i>&#x201d; his word for publishing in the golden age. In this fascinating and elegiac history, Al Silverman illuminates a period in publishing that was not only good, but formed a distinguishing landmark of culture in American life -- a golden time that certainly deserves a new life.</p></p><p>Al Silverman entered the publishing industry in 1972 as CEO of Book of the Month Club, after working for Sport magazine for twelve years. Later, he became president and editor-in-chief of The Viking Press, then a part of Penguin USA. He has written several books since.Al Silverman, the former head of Book-of-the-Month Club, remembers his experiences during what he calls the golden years of publishing. His recollections of the publishers, editors, and authors he met during that time--from 1946 to the early 1980s--make for a nostalgic but tedious story. The disconnected events have sparse continuity, and the hundreds of mostly obscure names have little relevance to someone outside the publishing industry. Narrator Tom Weiner reads at a brisk pace, with his baritone voice never dropping a word. Since the memoir wanders so much, the continuity of a strong reader creates a narrative drive that is lacking in the written manuscript.

As part of the Abrahamic Covenant, God promised to send a son to Abraham and Sarah (Gen. 17:19-22). They were both beyond normal childbearing ages and laughed at the prospect of being parents, yet they ultimately witnessed the miraculous arrival of their son, Isaac (Gen. 21:1-3). In Judges 13, an angel of the Lord told Manoah and his barren wife that they would have a special son. True to the heavenly messenger&#x2019;s words, Samson entered the world and for a time delivered the Israelites from the oppression of the Philistines. <p> Samuel, the first prophet, final judge, and anointer of kings, also demonstrated in his birth the providential power of God. He was the answer to the faithful, persevering prayers of his godly mother, Hannah, who had remained childless until then. John the Baptist&#x2019;s mother, Elizabeth, was also unable to have children until God graciously intervened when she was in her sixties or seventies and made her the mother of the forerunner of Christ (Luke 1:15-17, 76-79). But none of those special births was as amazing as the virgin birth of the Son of God, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p> <p><b><br> UNBELIEF REGARDING THE VIRGIN BIRTH</b></p> <p> Even though the fact of Jesus&#x2019; virgin birth is clearly and concisely stated in Scripture, the unconverted mind of sinful humanity, as with all essential doctrines of the Christian faith, resists embracing the truth of His unique birth.</p> <p> First of all, ancient mythologies and world religions counterfeited Christ&#x2019;s virgin birth with a proliferation of bizarre stories and inaccurate parallels. These stories undercut and minimized the uniqueness and profound impact of our Lord&#x2019;s birth. Several accounts illustrate the point. The Romans claimed that Zeus impregnated Semele without contact and produced Dionysus, lord of the earth. Babylonian religion asserted that a sunbeam in the priestess Semiramis conceived Tammuz, the Sumerian fertility god (Ezek. 8:14). Buddha&#x2019;s mother allegedly saw a large white elephant enter her belly when she conceived the deified Indian philosopher. Hinduism teaches that the divine Vishnu, after living as a fish, tortoise, boar, and lion, entered Devaki&#x2019;s womb and became her son, Krishna. Satan has propagated other similar legends, all with the purpose of undermining the nature of Christ&#x2019;s birth and deceiving people into seeing it as just another myth or nothing exceptional.</p> <p> In addition, the scientific age and the emergence of modern and postmodern theologies during the past two centuries have eroded many professed believers&#x2019; confidence in the reality of the virgin birth. (Along with that trend has been a noticeable decline in the percentage of &#x201c;Christians&#x201d; who believe in the deity of Christ.) But such skeptical thinking is foolish and directly contrary to the explicit teaching of all four Gospels, the Epistles, and the historical testimony of the entire early church that Jesus was none other than the virgin-born Son of God.</p> <p> Unfortunately, a heart attitude of unbelief concerning Jesus&#x2019; identity has characterized the majority of men and women since the Fall. The Jews who opposed Christ vividly illustrated that attitude on more than one occasion (John 5:18; 7:28-30; 10:30-39). But such hostility and lack of faith should not discourage us or deter us from embracing and defending the truth of Christ&#x2019;s virgin birth. The apostle Paul reminds us, &#x201c;For what if some did not believe? Will their unbelief make the faithfulness of God without effect? Certainly not! Indeed, let God be true but every man a liar&#x201d; (Rom. 3:3-4, 10:16; Isa. 53:1). The world&#x2019;s opinion, popular as it might be, is rarely a reliable source of truth.</p> <p> Undoubtedly, therefore, the Holy Spirit acted with significant purpose in devoting an early passage from the Gospel of Matthew, at the front of the New Testament, to establish right away the humanity and deity of our Lord. His incarnation, properly understood, is foundational to Christianity. There could have been no genuine work of redemption apart from the fact of God becoming man and, by being both completely God and completely man, reconciling people to Himself through His substitutionary death and physical resurrection. If Jesus had not been both human and divine, there would be no gospel. (For further discussion on the necessity of believing and proclaiming the truth of Christ&#x2019;s virgin birth and deity, see chapter 8 of my book Nothing but the Truth [Wheaton, Ill.: Crossway, 1999]).</p> <p> Many skeptical New Testament commentators will concede that Matthew and other authors of Scripture sincerely believed and taught that the Holy Spirit conceived Jesus without any assistance from a human father. But such interpreters nevertheless glibly discount the validity of Scripture&#x2019;s claims by immediately asserting that its writers were naive, uneducated, and subject to the myths and superstitions of ancient times. According to the critics, the Gospel writers merely adapted some of the familiar virgin birth legends to the story of Jesus&#x2019; birth.</p> <p> But nothing could be further from the truth. Matthew&#x2019;s account, for example, reads as history, but it is history he could know and record only because God revealed it and accomplished it by miraculous intervention. Matthew&#x2019;s words are far superior to the immoral and repulsive nature of the secular stories he and the other writers allegedly drew from. Here is his clear, uncomplicated narrative of the Incarnation:</p> <p> Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: After His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit. Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not wanting to make her a public example, was minded to put her away secretly. But while he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, &#x201c;Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.&#x201d; </p> <p> So all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying: &#x201c;Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel,&#x201d; which is translated, &#x201c;God with us.&#x201d; </p> <p> Then Joseph, being aroused from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took to him his wife, and did not know her till she had brought forth her firstborn Son. And he called His name Jesus. (Matthew 1:18-25)</p> <p> Matthew declares Jesus&#x2019; divine lineage in this passage and reveals five aspects of His virgin birth: its first announcement, Joseph&#x2019;s response to it, the angel&#x2019;s clarification of it, its connection to prophecy, and its actual occurrence.</p> <p><br> <b>THE VIRGIN BIRTH ANNOUNCED</b></p> <p> Matthew needs only one verse (1:18) to announce the fact of Christ&#x2019;s virgin birth. Such a concise statement, though it doesn&#x2019;t all by itself prove the point, strongly suggests that the notion of our Lord and Savior&#x2019;s virgin birth was not simply a man-made story. A human author, writing strictly on his own initiative, would characteristically tend to describe such a momentous and amazing event in an expansive, detailed, and elaborate manner. But not the apostle Matthew. He does relate additional circumstances surrounding the virgin birth, but the basic fact is stated in one simple sentence: &#x201c;After His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit.&#x201d;</p> <p> Matthew devotes the previous seventeen verses to Jesus&#x2019; human genealogy but just this part of one verse to His divine genealogy. As the Son of God, Jesus &#x201c;descended&#x201d; from His heavenly Father by a miraculous and never-repeated act of the Holy Spirit; even so, the Holy Spirit chose to announce that astounding truth by just one brief, declarative sentence. As all God&#x2019;s Word does, Matthew&#x2019;s simple statement contains the solemn tone of authenticity. By contrast, a human fabrication would tend to have that false ring of exaggeration to it, being filled out with much more &#x201c;convincing&#x201d; material than what this inspired version needed.</p> <p> Scripture gives us little information about Mary and even less about Joseph. Mary was undoubtedly a godly young woman, probably a native of Nazareth who came from a relatively poor family. Joseph was the son of Jacob (Matt. 1:16) and was a craftsman, probably a carpenter (13:55). Most significant, he was a &#x201c;just man&#x201d; (1:19), one who placed saving trust in the coming Messiah.</p> <p> Most likely Mary and Joseph were both quite young when they were engaged (&#x201c;betrothed&#x201d;). She may have been as young as twelve or thirteen, and he not any older than fifteen or sixteen. Such youthfulness at the time of a couple&#x2019;s engagement was standard for that culture. Another standard aspect of the Jewish betrothal was its binding nature-society considered the man and the woman legally married even though the formal ceremony and consummation might occur a year later. The purpose of the engagement period was to confirm each partner&#x2019;s fidelity when the two had little or no social contact with each another.</p> <p> Mary and Joseph faithfully abstained from sexual relations with one another during the engagement period, as the contract required. That was also in accord with the Bible&#x2019;s high regard for sexual purity and God&#x2019;s commands for sexual abstinence prior to the marriage ceremony and for sexual fidelity afterward. Thus, Mary&#x2019;s virginity was an important indicator of her godliness.</p> <p> However, Mary&#x2019;s virginity protected something much more important than her own morality and godly reputation. It ensured the deity of Christ and supported the veracity of His teaching and works as the Son of God. Had Jesus been conceived by natural means, with Joseph or anyone else as His father, He would not have been God and would not have been a true Savior of sinners. To be in accord with what Scripture reported about His life, He would have had to make false claims about Himself, and He would have had to endorse false stories or hoaxes concerning the Resurrection and Ascension. Meanwhile everyone would have remained spiritually dead, condemned forever by their unforgiven sins. But we know that all that is absolutely contrary to what God&#x2019;s Word teaches.</p> <p> The apostle Paul, for example, was also very clear and concise when he reiterated the true nature of the Incarnation: &#x201c;But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman&#x201d; (Gal. 4:4). Paul includes no mention of a human father for Jesus because, according to the divine plan, God was His Father. Jesus had one human parent (Mary) so that He could be a man and identify closely with what it means to be human (Phil. 2:5-7; Heb. 4:15). And He had divine parentage so He could live a sinless life, perfectly fulfill the Law of God for us, and make the perfect sacrifice for our sins.</p> <p> Admittedly, all these centuries after Matthew&#x2019;s divinely inspired Gospel declared that Jesus was born of a virgin, His miraculous conception remains impossible to understand by human reason alone. God chose not to explain the details of it to us, even as He chose to leave unexplained the intricacies of His creating the universe from nothing, the precise way He could be one God in three Persons, or exactly what happens when depraved sinners are born again as they repent of their sins and trust Christ. Many of the essentials of Christianity God wants believers to accept by faith. Full understanding will have to wait until heaven: &#x201c;For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now [we] know in part, but then [we] shall know [fully]&#x201d; (1 Cor. 13:12).</p> <p> <br> <b>JOSEPH&#x2019;S RESPONSE TO THE VIRGIN BIRTH</b></p> <p> Initial news of Mary&#x2019;s condition presented Joseph with a twofold problem. A caring and responsible person concerned about doing the right thing, Joseph was unwilling to proceed with his original plans once he perceived that a crucial part of those plans was no longer acceptable. His difficulty was intensified by the reality that he was a righteous man, genuinely concerned about doing what was morally and ethically right according to God&#x2019;s Law. First, when Joseph realized Mary was pregnant, he knew he could not go ahead with their marriage. He knew he was not the father and, based on what he knew at the time, he had to assume that another man was.</p> <p> Joseph&#x2019;s second difficult decision concerned how he should then treat Mary. Because he was a good and loving man, he was grieved at the thought of shaming her publicly (a common practice in those days when a wife was unfaithful), and even more so at the prospect of demanding her death, as provided for in Deuteronomy 22:23-24. We don&#x2019;t know if he felt anger, resentment, or bitterness, but he certainly experienced shame at what he had to assume was true. However, Joseph&#x2019;s concern was not primarily with his own shame and embarrassment, but with Mary&#x2019;s. Matthew 1:19 says, &#x201c;not wanting to make her a public example, [Joseph] was minded to put her away secretly.&#x201d;</p> <p> Therefore, Joseph&#x2019;s plan was to divorce Mary secretly so she would not have to endure the disgrace of everyone in the community knowing about her supposed sin. Not many husbands ever display such firmly held and deeply felt love for their wives. Of course eventually, when the marriage didn&#x2019;t occur, everyone would have found out that something had gone wrong. But at least in the meantime Mary would be protected from humiliation and death.</p> <p> The Lord, however, in His sovereign providence and wonderful grace, intervened directly into the situation and spared Joseph the further trauma of actually carrying out his divorce plans. &#x201c;But while he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, &#x2018;Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit&#x2019;&#x201d; (Matt. 1:20). This verse underscores the miraculous nature of the virgin birth and the supernatural character surrounding the entire event of Christ&#x2019;s birth. It also provides divine assurance to Joseph (&#x201c;son of David&#x201d;) and to us that Jesus had legitimate royal lineage that legally came through Joseph as a descendant of King David.</p> <p> The angel&#x2019;s words provide the ultimate and most irrefutable testimony to the essential truth of the virgin birth and to the proper response Joseph was to have to Mary&#x2019;s extraordinary situation.</p> <p><br> <b>THE ANGEL CLARIFIES THE VIRGIN BIRTH</b></p> <p> But what was the significance of Mary&#x2019;s pregnancy even though she had not had relations with Joseph or any other man? Joseph likely would have spent some time puzzling over that question if the divine messenger had not immediately clarified his pronouncement with these words, &#x201c;&#x2018;And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins&#x2019;&#x201d; (Matt. 1:21).</p> <p> The angel tells Joseph that Mary will actually bear a son. And not just any son, but Jesus, who &#x201c;will save His people from their sins.&#x201d; God chose the name Jesus for His Son because its basic meaning defined the fundamental, overarching purpose for the Son&#x2019;s...</p></p><h2>Not My Boy!: A Father, A Son, and One Family&#39;s Journey with Autism</h2><p>In <em>Not My Boy!</em>, Rodney Peete offers not only a heartrending, candid look inside his personal journey with his son's autism but a first-of-its-kind, inspirational road map that will help families facing similar challenges to move forward. Effectively woven throughout Peete's moving account of his life with his son R.J. are the powerful voices, insights, and dreams of other fathers, high-profile figures as well as unsung heroes, who've traveled this difficult path.<br><br> Autism affects four times as many boys as it does girls. For their fathers, expectations and hopes are drastically changed--as NFL star Rodney Peete's were when his son R.J. was diagnosed at the age of three. After a period of anger and denial, an all-too-common reaction among fathers, Rodney joined his wife, Holly, in her efforts to help their son. With determination, love, and understanding, the family worked with R.J. to help him once again engage with the world.<br><br> Eight challenging years later, R.J. has gone from the son one doctor warned would never say "I love you" to a thriving, vibrant boy who scored his first soccer goal while his dad cheered from the sidelines.<br><br> <strong>Praise for <em>Not My Boy!</em></strong><br><br> "I wish I had something fancy to say, but this story is simply beyond words--just read it! I vote to make Rodney's book, <em>Not My Boy!</em>, required reading for every first-time, second-time, or any-other-time father."<br>--Will Smith / actor, producer<br><br> "Rodney Peete writes a compelling book that will help fathers emotionally deal with the challenge of raising a child with autism. The mental toughness of a man all but disappears when faced with this reality, but Rodney's candid message will encourage anyone who is chosen to be on this journey."<br>--Alonzo Mourning, former NBA player<br><br> "<em>Not My Boy</em> is a must-read for parents--especially dads--who have a child on the autism spectrum. It's inspiring, enlightening, and most importantly, truthful. Rodney gives the reader the real story on how autism can cause total dysfunction in the family, and in even the strongest of marriages, if husband and wife don't work as a team. He opens up his heart, and speaks candidly about his mistakes, all the while learning how to best help R.J. in his battle to overcome the challenges of autism. Their fight is by no means over, but the experiences that he shares will help every family, and every couple, to be better advocates, teachers, and parents."<br>--Artie Kempner, lead director for NASCAR/NFL on Fox<br><br> "A book every father needs to read! <em>Not My Boy</em> is about unconditional love. I read it in one weekend. . . . It was and is amazing."<br>--Cyd Wilson, <em>InStyle</em> magazine</p><p>Rodney Peete is a former quarterback from the University of Southern California who played in the NFL for 16 years. After his retirement in 2004, Peete became one of the hosts of the Fox Sports Net talk show <em>The Best Damn Sports Show Period</em> alongside John Salley, Chris Rose, and Rob Dibble. In 1997, Peete and his wife, Holly Robinson, started the HollyRod Foundation, which seeks to provide fininancial, physical and emotional suppport to Parkinson's patients and their families/caregivers. The couple has twins, Rodney Jr. ("R.J.") and Ryan, and sons Robinson and Roman.Former NFL star quarterback Peete sheds his macho gridiron side and pours his heart out in his no-holds-barred family memoir, recounting the stresses of having a child with severe autism and the daunting challenge of realigning parental expectations. Recollecting golden memories of a supportive father's role in his successful life, he imagines a similar time with his son, R.J., but everything changes for the worse when R.J. is diagnosed with autism at age three. His marriage almost collapses under the weight of the diagnosis while his valiant wife, Holly Robinson Peete, emerges as the child's advocate amid Rodney's overwhelming anger and denial, ultimately triumphant in getting R.J. the proper attention. This invaluable parental primer on guiding an autistic child through the medical and therapeutic maze along with strengthening a besieged marriage will give renewed hope to all those in the same situation. A portion of this book's proceeds will go to autism charities. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Through the creation of this course, which he ended up teaching five times, first at the Naropa Institute and later at Brooklyn College, Ginsberg saw an opportunity to present the history of Beat Literature in his own inimitable way. Compiled and edited by renowned Beat scholar Bill Morgan, and with an introduction by Anne Waldman, <i>The Best Minds of My Generation</i> presents the lectures in edited form, complete with notes, and paints a portrait of the Beats as Ginsberg knew them: friends, confidantes, literary mentors, and fellow revolutionaries.<br> <br> Ginsberg was seminal to the creation of a public perception of Beat writers and knew all of the major figures personally, making him uniquely qualified to be the historian of the movement. In <i>The Best Minds of My Generation</i>, Ginsberg shares anecdotes of meeting Kerouac, Burroughs, and other writers for the first time, explains his own poetics, elucidates the importance of music to Beat writing, discusses visual influences and the cut-up method, and paints a portrait of a group who were leading a literary revolution. For Beat aficionados and neophytes alike, <i>The Best Minds of My Generation</i> is a personal yet critical look at one of the most important literary movements of the twentieth century.</p><p><b>Allen Ginsberg</b> (1926 1997) was a poet, activist, and one of the Beat Generation's most renowned writers.

His dramatic, theatrical approach to design has produced elegant period interiors that have influenced many other designers.<br><br>This handsome monograph, the first complete presentation of Mongiardino's work, explores his philosophy of space, design, and life itself. Extraordinary color photographs illustrate the brilliant arrangements of objects, art, and antiques and the rich array of textiles and painted effects-- faux wood, marble, and other materials, extravagant full-scale trompe l'oeils-- that epitomize his style. Mongiardino draws from sources that range from ancient Greek, Roman, and Etruscan artifacts to the work of the Renaissance and baroque masters Michelangelo, Palladio, Bernini, and Borromini and to antique fabrics, carpets, and <i>objets</i>; he also adds poetic recollections of important personal and historical spaces and incorporates his view of nature as a collaborator in the design process. Equally important is his ability to reflect the personality and lifestyle of his distinguished clients, whether in New York, London, Milan, Rome, or Paris. The resulting interior landscapes transform rooms into evocative surroundings of startling beauty.<br><br>Practical considerations of design are discussed in Mongiardino's own words. He shares his insights into particular spaces-- small or large, study or grand gallery-- and traces the solutions he originated to create them. Through early sketches, impressionistic drawings and watercolors, and detailed photographs, he unfolds the story of each space, highlighting both its particular challenges and the lessons to be learned from its ultimate success as a stunning environment for living.<br></p><p>"Everything in our lives takes place within a space that surrounds us, therefore within architecture," writes Mongiardino. Thus, the title Roomscapes aptly describes the work of this Italian architect and interior designer, internationally renowned for the creation of dramatic, theatrical interior landscapes. The first monograph devoted exclusively to Mongiardino's work and ideas, this book combines sketches, drawings, watercolors, and photographs of finished interior environments with the author's very readable exposition of his work's philosophical and practical underpinnings. The photography and layout are superb, and even though Mongiardino designs principally for the rich and famous, there is much to be learned here by anyone wishing to explore his approach to design.

She didn&#x2019;t do parties well, and she didn&#x2019;t enjoy them. Jonas Wyatt, Director of Breed Affairs, had given her permission to peruse the extensive collection of first-edition classics, but he had warned her that if one of his enforcers caught her there, they would drag her back to the party.</p><p>If she was found, she hoped that it wasn&#x2019;t by Noble Chavin. She smiled a bit at that thought. Noble loved books too, though. He would understand.</p><p>He was always at the library, choosing books she would never have expected him to read. Carpentry books, books on world history. He devoured them, it sometimes seemed. And when he returned them, she could quiz him playfully, and he always had the answers.</p><p>And he talked to her about the books. She liked that. Perhaps too much. And though he would probably talk to her, she doubted he would let her stay.</p><p>So when the door opened, she hid quickly. She expected the Breed entering the room to smell her instantly. She was a human, and fairly easy for a Breed to detect. Haley didn&#x2019;t understand why she didn&#x2019;t.</p><p>Maydene Brock was a Breed older, a nurse in the labs. With her graying brown hair and pinched expression, Haley had never really seen her as much of a caregiver.</p><p>And perhaps she might have sensed Haley if the men following her hadn&#x2019;t overpowered the room with the scent of cologne.</p><p>Haley wrinkled her nose at the smell. Even across the room, hidden behind a low shelf as she peeked between the books, she could smell the obnoxious scents.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you have payment ready?&#x201d; Maydene snapped.</p><p>&#x201c;We need the code,&#x201d; Phillip Brackenmore, the head of Brackenmore Pharmaceutical Research, informed the nurse dangerously. &#x201c;No code, no payment, Breed.&#x201d;</p><p>Maydene sniffed. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll meet you at the hotel with the code. We&#x2019;ll slip it out when Dr. Morrey arrives at the party. Everyone will be busy with her,&#x201d; she told them smugly. &#x201c;When you transfer payment, we&#x2019;ll hand you the code. I don&#x2019;t trust the two of you as much as you would like to think I should.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As long as you&#x2019;re there,&#x201d; Horace Engalls, president and CEO of Engalls Pharmaceuticals, replied. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t bother trying to betray us. We have our own spies watching you, Maydene.&#x201d;</p><p>Maydene growled at that. &#x201c;I know who your little bitch is. She can watch until hell freezes over. All we care about is the cash.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And all we care about is the information to complete our own research. The live trials on the Breeds you suggested aren&#x2019;t working out as well as we had hoped.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I warned you.&#x201d; Maydene&#x2019;s voice was smug as Haley felt chills race up her spine. &#x201c;Even Morrey isn&#x2019;t responding as well as you had hoped, is she? I told you, you need us.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So we do,&#x201d; Brackenmore drawled. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll meet you at the hotel and transfer the money to your account, but we&#x2019;ll see what we&#x2019;re paying for first. Understood?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Quite well,&#x201d; Maydene sneered. &#x201c;Return to the party now, before you&#x2019;re missed.&#x201d;</p><p>Haley peeked over the top of the books that lined the shelf she was hiding behind. She could barely see them, and as the door opened, she eased back down carefully, certain that if Maydene looked back, she would sense her.</p><p>She waited. She waited so long. She could feel her muscles cramping, feel the sweat that eased along her spine, but she could still feel the danger.</p><p>She looked up at the vent above her and inhaled slowly. Was that why Maydene hadn&#x2019;t smelled her? The vent pulled the air out of the library and circulated it, while another vent fed dry air into the library to protect the expensive books. That combined with the scent of men&#x2019;s cologne must have hidden Haley&#x2019;s scent.</p><p>But Maydene must have suspected that someone was in the room. As Haley began to consider the risk of peeking over the books again, she heard movement, a doorknob turning, a muttered curse.</p><p>She took a chance and watched as the Breed made her way from the library.</p><p>Just a few more minutes, she told herself. If Maydene was suspicious, she might watch the door from outside. She might be waiting for whoever she had sensed.</p><p>My God, what were they talking about? Drugging Breeds? Selling information? She had to find Noble. The Breed enforcer would know what to do&#x2014;he would know how to handle this. She had to find him before Maydene and whoever was helping her managed to slip from the estate.</p><p>Carefully, she moved from behind the shelf, thankful that someone had made the little hidden reading nook that Merinus had shown her a few weeks before. It had possibly saved her life.</p><p>Now, to sneak out of the library and get to Noble.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>There was something about librarian Haley McQuire and her staid little outfits that just made Jaguar Breed enforcer Noble Chavin insane.</p><p>He should be watching the ballroom, keeping his eyes trained on the two men they knew would make an attempt tonight to gain confidential Breed information from a source within Sanctuary.</p><p>Breeds betraying Breeds, for money. For greed. And the humans determined to destroy them. Several Breeds had already been killed in the past day, and if they didn&#x2019;t stop that information from going out, then more would die.</p><p>It had to be insanity, he decided again, as Haley stepped into the ballroom from the direction of the ladies&#x2019; room down the hall, because nothing else could describe his reaction to how completely luscious she looked in the simple black, long-sleeved ball gown. Or how she snagged his attention against all his best efforts.</p><p>The gown swept the floor, the hem floating around her like a dark, sexy dream as he tried to keep his eyes off her. He was there to increase security, not to ogle the little librarian, who seemed to hug the wall more than she danced.</p><p>But his eyes had a will of their own. His gaze swept over the full skirt of the gown, lifted to her curved hips and trim waist, and he had to swallow as he came to where the material draped from her shoulders and barely hid the hint of curvy, sweet breasts beneath. She might have believed she had succeeded in hiding those curves with the folds of material that draped over them, but he could have assured her, nothing was further from the truth.</p><p>He should have stopped there. Dammit, he had no business looking further. But he did anyway. He let his eyes caress the smooth, creamy flesh above the material, the graceful arch of her throat.</p><p>A stubborn chin. There was fire in her. Soft rosebud lips, a pert nose, and eyes that mesmerized. Dammit to hell, he knew better, but there he was, staring into eyes that seemed to be looking right back at him. Dove gray and ringed with the merest hint of blue. Thick chestnut lashes surrounded them, and they stared back at him as though as helpless as he to break the connection.</p><p>Fiery red hair surrounding a gently sculpted face, added spark and fire to her eyes, and the look of her had his back teeth clenching as he fought unsuccessfully to drag his gaze away.</p><p>Back to her feet. Where the tip of one small black shoe peeked out beneath her dress. The dress flowed around her, drifted and moved like a whisper as though teasing him, tempting him to brush it from her legs to see all the pale, beautiful flesh he knew it hid.</p><p>Damn, if she didn&#x2019;t draw his gaze like a hidden flame, one he was certain would erupt into a conflagration.</p><p>He forced his gaze away then, far away, not even looking at her feet but at her slender, graceful fingers. She wore no rings. No adornments. As though proclaiming to the world no ties and no bonds. She was as free as the wind yet restrained by some force inside her.</p><p>And she was moving toward him.</p><p>Noble let his gaze move to her face once again, a frown edging at his brows, a sense of foreboding rasping at the back of his neck at the look on her face.</p><p>Perhaps he should have paid more attention to her face. Because there was an edge of fear in those odd, blue-ringed gray eyes and the pinched line of her lips. Her face was pale, but her chin was lifted in determination and purpose.</p><p>His gaze moved around the room then. She had come out of the hall and into the ballroom no more than minutes after Phillip Brackenmore and Horace Engalls had entered, the two pharmaceutical and drug-research magnates.</p><p>&#x201c;Noble.&#x201d; She all but whispered his name, and he heard the sound, that soft hint of longing he wondered if she even knew was in her voice, at the same moment he glimpsed the entrance of the ballroom from his peripheral vision.</p><p>He gripped her arm and jerked her behind him, ignoring her soft little cry as orders began to snap into the communications link at his ear.</p><p>&#x201c;You stay!&#x201d; He jerked her to the corner and pushed her into the little alcove created by the fronds of several potted plants. He pushed her to the floor and pointed his finger to her pale face. &#x201c;Stay till I come for you. Understand?&#x201d;</p><p>She nodded quickly even as he turned away and began snapping orders to other guests, herding them quickly from the confrontation brewing at the ballroom&#x2019;s entrance and into the buffet room.</p><p>Why he hadn&#x2019;t pushed little Miss Haley McQuire into the more secure room, he couldn&#x2019;t explain. It was something about her eyes, that edge of fear, and the fact that she had entered after Brackenmore and Engalls more than anything else.</p><p>Or it could have been that niggle of insanity that he had been trying to ignore for months.</p><p>&#x201c;Librarian Haley McQuire is secured in the far left corner of the ballroom, leave her in place,&#x201d; he spoke into the small mic that curved along his cheek as he helped secure the ballroom.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s a hazard in the ballroom,&#x201d; he was told, Rule&#x2019;s voice cold. &#x201c;Get her with the others.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Negative,&#x201d; he refused the order. &#x201c;Something isn&#x2019;t right with that, Rule.

The bastards needed to die now, not later.</p><p>&#x201c;Please come with me, Mr. Brackenmore, Mr. Engalls,&#x201d; he requested, his voice carefully bland, unemotional. He wanted to kill rather than react politely.</p><p>Those damned animal genetics. He could feel the blood he needed to spill for the threat this man represented to the Breeds.</p><p>&#x201c;What the hell is going on here?&#x201d; Brackenmore blustered, as Noble gripped his arm and began to move him, his wife, and Engalls to the entrance, waiting for the final go-ahead from Rule to escort them from the estate.</p><p>&#x201c;Director Wyatt will discuss this with you soon, I&#x2019;m certain.&#x201d; Noble flashed his canines in a tight, hard smile as he watched the other Breeds filling the room, keeping a careful barrier between the guests and the clean-up of the situation that had just arisen.</p><p>Felines weren&#x2019;t the only ones in attendance.

He could still see the very edge of her skirt peeking out from where he had pushed her.</p><p>The Coyote Breed, Mordecai, his face scarred, his icy blue eyes filled with death, took Brackenmore and the others, and Noble strode across the ballroom quickly.</p><p>Haley was still huddled there and stared back at him, her eyes wide and touched with courage and trepidation. He held his hand out to her and watched as she lifted hers, her fingers trembling as he gripped them.</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re monsters,&#x201d; she whispered, and though her eyes were dry, sorrow filled them. &#x201c;Noble, they&#x2019;re monsters.&#x201d;</p><p>The fine hairs along his body lifted in warning, but even worse, the spots along his shoulders began to tingle in foreboding.

Its survival has been an incredible journey, especially considering how often Jews have tried to kill it themselves. Underlying Neal Karlen's unique, brashly entertaining, yet thoroughly researched telling of the language's story is the notion that Yiddish is a mirror of Jewish history, thought, and practice&#x2014;for better and worse. </p><p>Karlen charts the beginning of Yiddish as a minor dialect in medieval Europe that helped peasant Jews live safely apart from the marauders of the First Crusades. Incorporating a large measure of antique German dialects, Yiddish also included little scraps of French, Italian, ancient Hebrew, Aramaic, the Slavic and Romance languages, and a dozen other tongues native to the places where Jews were briefly given shelter. One may speak a dozen languages, all of them Yiddish.</p><p>By 1939, Yiddish flourished as the lingua franca of 13 million Jews. After the Holocaust, whatever remained of Yiddish, its worldview and vibrant culture, was almost stamped out&#x2014;by Jews themselves. Yiddish was an old-world embarrassment for Americans anxious to assimilate. In Israel, young, proud Zionists suppressed Yiddish as the symbol of the weak and frightened ghetto-bound Jew&#x2014;and invented modern Hebrew. </p><p>Today, a new generation has zealously sought to explore the language and to embrace its soul. This renaissance has spread to millions of non-Jews who now know the subtle difference between a <em>shlemiel</em> and a <em>shlimazel</em>; hundreds of Yiddish words dot the most recent editions of the Oxford English Dictionary.</p><p><em>The Story of Yiddish</em> is a delightful tale of a people, their place in the world, and the fascinating language that held them together.</p></p><p>The Last One Thousand Years of Jewish History is Inseparable from The Story of Yiddish. <p> </p><p> Yiddish --an oft-considered "gutter language--is an unlikely survivor of the ages, much like the Jews themselves.

Written at an appropriate level of understanding for those new to the world of abstract mathematics, it limits depth of coverage and areas covered to topics of <i>genuine</i> use in computer science. Chapter topics include fundamentals, logic, counting, relations and digraphs, trees, topics in graph theory, languages and finite-state machines, and groups and coding. For individuals interested in computer science and other related fields &#x2014; looking for an introduction to discrete mathematics, or a bridge to more advanced material on the subject.</p><p>More than any other text in this field, this text ties together discrete topics with a theme. Written at an appropriate level of rigor -- with a strong pedagogical focus -- it limits depth of coverage and areas covered to topics of genuine use in computer science. It stresses both basic theory and applications -- providing students with a firm foundation for more advanced courses.<p> Discrete mathematics is an interesting course to teach and to study at the freshman and sophomore level for several reasons. Its content is mathematics, but most of its applications and more than half its students are from computer science. Thus careful motivation of topics and previews of applications are important and necessary strategies. Moreover, there are a number of substantive and diverse topics covered in the course, so a text must proceed clearly and carefully, emphasizing key ideas with suitable pedagogy. In addition, the student is often expected to develop an important new skill: the ability to write a mathematical proof. This skill is excellent training for writing good computer programs. </p> <p> This text can be used by students in mathematics as an introduction to the fundamental ideas of discrete mathematics, and a foundation for the development of more advanced mathematical concepts. If used in this way, the topics dealing with specific computer science applications can be ignored or selected independently as important examples. The text can also be used in a computer science or computer engineering curriculum to present the foundations of many basic computer-related concepts and provide a coherent development and common theme for these ideas. The instructor can easily develop a suitable course by referring to the chapter prerequisites which identify material needed by that chapter. </p> <p><b>Approach</b></p> <p> First, we have limited both the areas covered and the depth of coverage to what we deem prudent in a first course taught at the freshman and sophomore level. We have identified a set of topics that we feel are of genuine use in computer science and elsewhere and that can be presented in a logically coherent fashion. We have presented an introduction to these topics along with an indication of how they can be pursued in greater depth. This approach makes our text an excellent reference for upper-division courses. </p> <p> Second, the material has been organized and interrelated to minimize the mass of definitions and the abstraction of some of the theory. Relations and digraphs are treated as two aspects of the same fundamental mathematical idea, with a directed graph being a pictorial representation of a relation. This fundamental idea is then used as the basis of virtually all the concepts introduced in the book, including functions, partial orders, graphs, and mathematical structures. Whenever possible, each new idea introduced in the text uses previously encountered material and, in turn, is developed in such a way that it simplifies the more complex ideas that follow. </p> <p><b>What Is New in the Fifth Edition</b></p> <p> We continue to believe that this book works well in the classroom because of the unifying role played by the two key concepts: relations and digraphs. In this edition we have woven in a thread of coding in all its aspects, efficiency, effectiveness, and security. Two new sections, Other Mathematical Structures and Public Key Cryptology are the major components of this thread, but smaller related insertions begin in Chapter 1. The number of exercises for this edition has been increased by more than 25%. Whatever changes we have made, our objective has remained the same as in the first four editions: <i>to present the basic notions of discrete mathematics and some of its applications .in a clear and concise manner that will be understandable to the student.</i> </p> <ul> <li>A cryptology thread begins in Chapter 1 and presents the basic ideas of the field. The thread concludes in Public Key Cryptology. Included now is coding in all its aspects, efficiency, effectiveness, and security.</li> <li>A new section, Other Mathematical Structures, introduces the basic concepts of rings and fields, in particular <i>Zp</i>.</li> <li>More opportunities for students to build modeling skills are provided. Whether seen as modeling, abstraction, pattern recognition, or problem solving, the ability to see the mathematical bones of a problem is a critical factor for success in higher-level mathematics courses.</li> <li>Understanding proofs and writing simple proofs are important course goals. More occasions for students to read, analyze, complete, and produce proofs are presented throughout the text, not just in the sections that introduce formal proofs.</li> <li>More applications are included. Among these are relational databases, check digits, a variety of ciphers, and weighted voting systems.</li> <li>New exercises have been added to each chapter. Greater emphasis has been placed on multiple representations of concepts. There are approximately 400 more exercises than in the fourth edition.</li> <li>A brief historical commentary opens each chapter and introduces some of the major contributors to that chapter's topics.</li> <li>Isomorphism is presented in more contexts than before throughout the book.</li> <li>Additional student experiments have been developed on weighted voting systems, Petri nets, and Catalan numbers. Experiments have been integrated into appropriate chapters and others are gathered in Appendix B. These assignments provide opportunities for exploration and discovery, as well as for writing, and are designed for collaborative work.</li> <li>This edition continues to weave the discussion of proofs and proof techniques throughout the book with comments on most proofs, exercises related to the mechanics of proving statements, and Tips for Proofs sections. Many of the new exercises provide more practice in building proof-reading and proof-writing skills.</li> <li>Each chapter now has a set of review questions. These are mainly conceptual in nature and help students identify the "big" ideas of the chapter.</li> <li>A glossary for quick reference is now included.</li> <li>The index contains approximately 100 new entries related to both new concepts and to new examples for material in previous editions.</li> </ul> <p><b>Exercises</b></p> <p> The exercises form an integral part of the book. Many are computational in nature, whereas others are of a theoretical type. Many of the latter and the experiments, to be further described below, require verbal solutions. Exercises to help develop proof-writing skills ask the student to analyze proofs, amplify arguments, or complete partial proofs. Guidance and practice in recognizing key elements and patterns have been extended in many new exercises. Answers to all odd-numbered exercises, review questions, and self-test items appear in the back of the book. Solutions to all exercises appear in the <b>Instructor's Solutions Manual,</b> which is available (to instructors only) gratis from the publisher. The Instructor's Solutions Manual also includes notes on the pedagogical ideas underlying each chapter, goals and grading guidelines for the experiments, and a test bank. </p> <p><b>Experiments</b></p> <p> Chapters 1 through 10 each end with a student experiment. These provide opportunities for discovery and exploration, or a more in-depth look at topics discussed in the text. They are designed as extended-time, out-of-class experiences and are suitable for group work. Each experiment requires significantly more writing than section exercises do. Some additional experiments are to be found in Appendix B. Content, prerequisites, and goals for each experiment are given in the Instructor's Solutions Manual. </p> <p><b>End-of-Chapter Material</b></p> <p> Each chapter contains Tips for Proofs, a summary of Key Ideas for Review, a set of Coding Exercises, an Experiment, a set of conceptual Review Questions, and a Self-Test covering the chapter's material. </p> <p><b>Organization</b></p> <p> Chapter 1 contains material that is fundamental to the course. This includes sets, subsets, and their operations; sequences; properties of the integers, including base n representations; matrices; and mathematical structures. A goal of this chapter is to help students develop skills in identifying patterns on many levels. Chapter 2 covers logic and related material, including methods of proof and mathematical induction. Although the discussion of proof is based on this chapter, the commentary on proofs continues throughout the book. Chapter 3, on counting, deals with permutations, combinations, the pigeonhole principle, elements of probability, and recurrence relations. </p> <p> Chapter 4 presents basic types and properties of relations, along with their representation as directed graphs. Connections with matrices and other data structures are also explored in this chapter. Chapter 5 deals with the notion of a function and gives important examples of functions, including functions of special interest in computer science. An introduction to the growth of functions is developed. Chapter 6 covers partially ordered sets, including lattices and Boolean algebras. A symbolic version for finding a Boolean function for a Boolean expression joins the pictorial Kamaugh method. Chapter 7 introduces directed and undirected trees along with applications of these ideas. Elementary graph theory with applications to transport networks and matching problems is the focus of Chapter 8. </p> <p> In Chapter 9 we return to mathematical structures and present the basic ideas of semigroups, groups, rings, and fields. By building on work in previous chapters, only a few new concepts are needed. Chapter 10 is devoted to finite-state machines. It complements and makes effective use of ideas developed in previous chapters. Chapter 11 finishes our discussion of coding for error detecting and correction and for security purposes. Appendix A discusses algorithms and pseudocode. The simplified pseudocode presented here is used in some text examples and exercises; these may be omitted without loss of continuity. Appendix B gives some additional experiments dealing with extensions or previews of topics in various parts of the course. </p></p><h2>A Field Guide to the Ferns and Their Related Families of Northeastern and Central North America With a Section on Species Also Found in the British I</h2><p>A handbook of ferns and their related families in the North American continent based on visual identification</p><p></p><h2>Chilton Nissan Titan/Armada 2004-2014 Repair Manual: Covers All U.s. and Canadian Modes of Titan (2004 Thru 2014) &amp; Armada (2005 Thru 2014) Two- and ...

While it does not presuppose an earlier course, many connections between linear algebra and calculus are worked into the discussion. A special feature is the inclusion of sections devoted to applications of linear algebra, which can either be part of a course, or used for independent study, and new to this edition is a section on analytic methods in matrix theory, with applications to Markov chains in probability theory. Proofs of all the main theorems are included, and are presented on an equal footing with methods for solving numerical problems. Worked examples are integrated into almost every section, to bring out the meaning of the theorems, and illustrate techniques for solving problems. Many numerical exercises make use of all the ideas, and develop computational skills, while exercises of a theoretical nature provide opportunities for students to discover for themselves.</p><p><br><p>Fourth Edition</p> <p>C.W.

Reich comes across as a crank, but a fascinating and human figure all the same. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p>In August 1934, without warning or explanation, Wilhelm Reich was expelled from the International Psychoanalytic Association. Political expediency and the organization&#39;s growing adherence to Freud&#39;s death instinct theory had prevailed over Reich&#39;s scientific efforts to understand the functioning of what Freud had termed &#34;libido&#34;. The provocative originality of Reich&#39;s work in the years to follow would inevitably distance him from Freudian psychology. But the result was an extraordinary widening of his scientific interests, scrupulously documented in these journals and letters. They record his pioneering laboratory experiments to verify the reality of the pleasure function and his discovery of an unknown energy that exists in all living matter. They record, too, the anguish of a man unafraid to speak his truth in the face of attack and defamation, even though it cost him his profession, his homeland and his adopted country, his wife, his two children, and his lover. In her introduction to the volume, Mary Boyd Higgins of the Wilhelm Reich Infant Trust considers key events and themes of Reich&#39;s life and work during the years leading up to 1934.<p><b>Wilhelm Reich</b>, a native of Austria, was born in 1897.

The material is readable. It uses humor effectively. It is nicely introspective when appropriate, and yet in the end it is forthright and decisive....This is a tour de force on the subject of architectural documentation."</i> <br>&#x2014;Robert Glass, Editor-in-Chief, <i>Journal of Systems and Software</i> and Editor/Publisher, <i>The Software Practitioner</i> </p> <p>For all but the most trivial software systems, you must pay close attention to the architecture&#x2014;the conceptual glue that holds every phase of a project together for its many stakeholders. Without an architecture that is appropriate for the problem being solved, the project will stumble along or, most likely, fail. Even with a superb architecture, if that architecture is not well understood or well communicated&#x2014;in other words, well documented&#x2014;the project cannot be considered a complete success.</p> <p>Although architecture is now widely recognized as a critical element in software development, there has been little guidance independent of language or notation on how to capture it. Based on the authors' extensive experience, <b> <i>Documenting Software Architectures</i> </b> helps you decide what information to document, and then, with guidelines and examples (in various notations, including UML), shows you how to express an architecture in a form that everyone can understand. If you go to the trouble of creating a strong architecture, you must also be prepared to describe it thoroughly and clearly, and to organize it so that others can quickly find the information they need.</p> <p>Essential topics for practitioners include:</p> <ul> <li>Seven rules for sound documentation</li> <li>The uses of software architecture documentation, including goals and strategies</li> <li>Architectural views and styles, with general introductions and specific examples</li> <li>Documenting software interfaces and software behavior</li> <li>Templates for capturing and organizing information to generate a coherent package</li> </ul> <br> <br> 0201703726B08222002<p> <b>Paul Clements</b> is a senior member of the technical staff at the SEI, where he works on software architecture and product line engineering.

Siegfried Zielinski argues that the history of the media does not proceed predictably from primitive tools to complex machinery; in<i> Deep Time of the Media</i>, he illuminates turning points of media history&#x2015;fractures in the predictable&#x2015;that help us see the new in the old.</p><p>Drawing on original source materials, Zielinski explores the technology of devices for hearing and seeing through two thousand years of cultural and technological history. He discovers the contributions of "dreamers and modelers" of media worlds, from the ancient Greek philosopher Empedocles and natural philosophers of the Renaissance and Baroque periods to Russian avant-gardists of the early twentieth century. "Media are spaces of action for constructed attempts to connect what is separated," Zielinski writes. He describes models and machines that make this connection: including a theater of mirrors in sixteenth-century Naples, an automaton for musical composition created by the seventeenth-century Jesuit Athanasius Kircher, and the eighteenth-century electrical tele-writing machine of Joseph Mazzolari, among others. Uncovering these moments in the media-archaeological record, Zielinski says, brings us into a new relationship with present-day moments; these discoveries in the "deep time" media history shed light on today's media landscape and may help us map our expedition to the media future.</p></p><p>Siegfried Zielinski, a founder of the new field of media archaeology, is Founding Director of the Academy of Media Arts in Cologne, where he is Professor of Media and Communication Studies and is developing a workshop for a variantology of the media. He has published more than a dozen books and many articles. <i>Deep Time of the Media</i> is the second of his books to appear in English.<p><i>Deep Time of Media</i> is an extraordinary gift. Next to the canonical geniuses of the past, Siegfried Zielinski introduces us to a host of unknown philosophers, visionaries, and inventors who turn out to be great precursors to the world of modern media.

Born in Zwickau, Germany, Schumann began piano instruction at age seven and immediately developed a passion for music. When a permanent injury to his hand prevented him from pursuing a career as a touring concert pianist, he turned his energies and talents to composing, writing hundreds of works for piano and voice, as well as four symphonies and an opera. Here acclaimed biographer Martin Geck tells the fascinating story of this multifaceted genius, set in the context of the political and social revolutions of his time.&nbsp;The image of Schumann the man and the artist that emerges in Geck&#x2019;s book is complex. Geck shows Schumann to be not only a major composer and music critic&#x2014;he cofounded and wrote articles for the controversial <i>Neue Zeitschrift f�r Musik��</i>&#x2014;but also a political activist, the father of eight children, and an addict of mind-altering drugs. Through hard work and determination bordering on the obsessive, Schumann was able to control his demons and channel the tensions that seethed within him into music that mixes the popular and esoteric, resulting in compositions that require the creative engagement of reader and listener.&nbsp;The more we know about a composer, the more we hear his personality in his music, even if it is above all on the strength of his work that we love and admire him. Martin Geck&#x2019;s book on Schumann is not just another rehashing of Schumann&#x2019;s life and works, but an intelligent, personal interpretation of the composer as a musical, literary, and cultural personality.</p><p><p><b>Martin Geck</b> is professor of musicology at the Technical University of Dortmund. He is the author of more than two dozen books, including <i>Johann Sebastian Bach: Life and Work</i>. <b>Stewart Spencer </b>is an independent scholar and the translator of more than three dozen books.</p>&#x201c;[A] fine biography. . . . [T]his is the most balanced account of Schumann&#x2019;s life and work for more than a generation, one that makes us want to relisten to Schumann&#x2019;s music, knowing better the man behind it.&#x201d; (Norman Lebrecht <i>Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The most romantic of Romantic composers, Schumann yet took J. S. Bach and Beethoven as his masters, and his music is full of references to both. Geck notes virtually all those illusions and inspirations as he hews closely to his demonstration of his subject&#x2019;s originality. . . . [A] superb biography.&#x201d; (Ray Olson <i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Schumann&#x2019;s aesthetics are Geck&#x2019;s primary and most satisfying focus: life and work emerge as indivisible, for that was how Schumann himself saw it. . . . A rewarding read.&#x201d; (Jessica Duchen <i>BBC Music Magazine</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A masterfully written account that shows just how lively and controversial the works and writings of this remarkable musician-poet remain, even at a distance of two centuries.&#x201d; (George B. Stauffer <i>Weekly Standard</i>)<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;In twelve chapters, Martin Geck vividly and knowledgably portrays the life of Schumann: his compositions, the forces that drove him, and the highly politicized era in which he lived.&#x201d; (<i>North German Broadcasting</i>)<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Geck&#x2019;s book helps us conceive of Schumann to be a much more modern figure in the realm of fine arts than we have thus far perceived him to be.&#x201d; (<i>Mannheimer Morgen</i>)<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;A discerning and demonstrative biography.&#x201d; (<i>Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung</i>)<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Geck has written an integrating portrayal of the life and work based on solid scholarship and with particular perspectives deepened by original and idiosyncratic excursions. Martin Geck possesses a valuable ability that is unfortunately not very common. It is one of the strengths of his book: to write intelligently and vividly about music without falling into concert guide metaphorics. If he inspires this or that reader to listen to Schumann&#x2019;s music, then an important goal has been reached. His book is carried along by his own admiration for the outsider Robert Schumann.&#x201d; (<i>Literarische Welt</i>)<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Geck tells the story in a masterfully focused way and with illuminating examination.&#x201d; (<i>Deutschlandradio</i>)<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Martin Geck tells the fascinating life of this universal soul of the Romantic Period, describing while doing so the social and artistic revolutions of his time. He throws new light on the multifaceted work of this composer&#x2014;and reveals the abysses of the man Robert Schumann.&#x201d; (<i>ComON!</i>)</p><h2>The Complete M1 Garand: A Guide for the Shooter and Collector</h2><p>A heavily illustrated, practical history for shooters and collectors alike, this book tells the complete story of the robust M1 Garand.

Students are able to grasp the material easily. The material is organized in a logical manner which makes lecturing a pleasure. Students tend to "get" the material which allows us to move to the next level of inquiry in the course."<br><br>"Approach: The approach of this text is superior to competitors. The author relates to students by admitting the challenges associated with contract law; she has chosen cases and "side notes" that not only pertain to the chapter and topic, but also entertain and intrigue the legal student's mind; the comics demonstrate her understanding of a student and their constant state of reading and researching. Organization: The organization is superior to others because the contract basics are covered completely in the first 11 chapters. I appreciate this because the essential information is covered immediately and clearly. Chapters 12-19 can be added throughout the essential chapters or utilized after completing the first 11 chapters. This is appealing as an instructor because it gives me the freedom to tailor my course as necessary. Other texts that have lengthy chapters covering more material than my course dictates require me to omit mid-chapter, which can be confusing to students. Readability: The wording is conversational and kind. Examples and exhibits are relatable and even humorous and lighthearted at times. This makes it easy and enjoyable for students to read."</p><h2>Songs of Innocence and of Experience (The Illuminated Books of William Blake, Volume 2) (Blake, 1)</h2><p><p>The core of William Blake's vision, his greatness as one of the British Romantics, is most fully expressed in his Illuminated Books, masterworks of art and text intertwined and mutually enriching. In 1949 the William Blake Trust was founded to bring these rare, in some cases unique, works to a wider general audience through the publication of superbly produced facsimiles of each book. By the late 1980's these facsimiles had themselves become rare books. The Trust accordingly resolved to initiate a collected edition that would publish accurate reproductions of all the Illuminated Books to be accompanied by notes and commentaries by leading Blake scholars. <i>Songs of Innocence and of Experience,</i> one of the best known of the books, is now reproduced in paperback for the first time from the King's College, Cambridge copy--sometimes known as "Blake's own copy."

For decades, he has worked to illuminate some of the most obscure metaphysical issues, often using popular film, theatre, novels, and comic books to illustrate his ideas, and as a result he has gained a reputation as both a happy sage and a singular mind.&nbsp;In <i>The Real and Its Double,</i> expertly translated by Chris Turner, Rosset takes on the question of the Real and humanity&#x2019;s natural ability to sidestep and bypass it. The key to this type of evasion, Rosset suggests, is a certain form of oracular thinking that lies buried in the origins of Western metaphysics and psychology. Here, Rosset eschews the prolix and paradoxical psychological theories of Derrida and Lacan in favor of an exceptional lucidity that speaks to his Nietzschean-tragic love of life.&nbsp;If good philosophy can be defined as expressing complicated things in a simple way, then here, in one of his best-known works, Rosset has proven himself a master.</p><p><p></p><b>Cl�ment Rosset</b> was educated at L'�cole normale sup�rieure, Paris.

Each has their own problems, from absent parents to supporting their family, getting into a good college to making the next hit holo-film. But those problems were nothing next to the threat now facing their world: The alien alliance known as the Covenant is laying siege to Meridian, for reasons that aren't so easily explained. <br><br>With their village in flames, the four teens find themselves stuck aboveground, locked out of the town shelter where the rest of the survivors are gathered. Together, Saskia, Dorian, Evie, and Victor are thrust into battle with nothing but a few scavenged weapons and an injured Spartan, one of the UNSC's super-soldiers. What's forged from the destruction will determine the fate of Meridian, and tilt the battle for humanity's survival.</p><p>Cassandra Rose Clarke's work has been nominated for the Philip K. Dick Award, the Romantic Times Reviewer's Choice Award, the Pushcart Prize, and YALSA's Best Fiction for Young Adults.

She holds an MA in creative writing from the University of Texas at Austin, and in 2010 she attended the Clarion West Writer's Workshop in Seattle. Her latest novel is <i>Star's End</i>, out now from Saga Press.Gr 7 Up-It was just a normal day on the human colony world Meridian. Saskia is yet again abandoned at home by her parents' top secret assignments from the United Nations Space Command (UNSC). Evie and Victor are arguing about the film they are creating, and holo-film star Dorian is on a boat about to play a gig with his band. Without warning, the Covenant attacks, and the town's survivors are ushered into shelters. Saskia, Dorian, Evie, and Victor find themselves in the middle of a battleground with few weapons. Luckily, they run into an injured Spartan who begrudgingly assists them in fighting the Covenant to save their town. This harrowing adventure is told in alternating viewpoints. The teen protagonists discover why the Covenant has attacked and must open the shelter and leave Meridian before their planet is demolished. Fans of the Halo video game franchise will recognize many concepts and creatures in this volume, such as Sangheili, Unggoy, Needler, and Glassing. However, Clarke offers just enough background information for readers unfamiliar with the "Halo" series to enjoy the story and be excited for the next installment.

Thomas Sowell traces its evolution as it emerged from successive controversies, particularly two of the most bitter and long lasting in the history of the discipline, the "general glut controversy" that reached a peak in the 1820s, and the Keynesian Revolution of the 1930s. These controversies not only involved almost every noted economist of the time but had repercussions on basic economic theory, methodology, and sociopolitical theory. This book, the first comprehensive coverage of the subject, will be an indispensable addition to the history of economic thought. It is also relevant to all social sciences concerned with economic prosperity, with the nature of intellectual orthodoxy and insurgency, or with the complex relationships among ideology, concepts, and policies.</p><p>Originally published in 1972.</p><p>The <b>Princeton Legacy Library</b> uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

As a child she witnessed the upheavals of post-colonial Africa, danger, flight, the bitterness or exile in Britain and the terrible consequences of her dissident father&#x2019;s stand against tyranny.<br><br>Mohamed Forna was a man of unimpeachable integrity and enchanting charisma. As Sierra Leone faced its future as a fledgling democracy, he was a new star in the political firmament, a man who had been one of the first black students to come to Britain after the war. He stole the heart of Aminatta&#x2019;s mother to the dismay of her Presbyterian parents and returned with her to Sierra Leone. But as Aminatta Forna shows with compelling clarity, the old Africa was torn apart by new ways of western parliamentary democracy, which gave birth only to dictatorships and corruption of hitherto undreamed-of magnitude. It was not long before Mohamed Forna languished in jail as a prisoner of conscience, and worse to follow.<br><br>Aminatta&#x2019;s search for the truth that shaped both her childhood and the nation&#x2019;s destiny began among the country&#x2019;s elite and took her into the heart of rebel territory. Determined to break the silence surrounding her father&#x2019;s fate, she ultimately uncovered a conspiracy that penetrated the highest reaches of government and forced the nation&#x2019;s politicians and judiciary to confront their guilt. The Devil that Danced on the Water is a book of pain and anger and sorrow, written with tremendous dignity and beautiful precision: a remarkable, and important, story of Africa.<br></p><p>Aminatta Forna is an author, broadcaster and journalist.Forna saw her father for the last time on July 30, 1974; she was 10 years old. In this harrowing memoir-cum-detective story, journalist Forna searches for the truth about her father's execution in Sierra Leone after his treason conviction for allegedly attempting a coup upon the government in which he had once been a cabinet minister. Mohamed Forna, a British-educated doctor and activist in what was, in the 1960s, a fledgling democracy extricating itself from British colonialist rule, resigned from what had become a dictatorship rife with corruption and chaos. The consequences of that resignation culminated in eight executions and precipitated the descent into anarchy of Africa's poorest nation. Forna writes with a compelling mix of distance and anguish, intent on explaining her father's death and reclaiming his memory. Lush descriptions of her idyllic childhood provide eerie counterpoint to chilling depictions of the hell Sierra Leone had become upon her return in recent years, a place where bands of child warriors, hacking off limbs as both punishment and warning, have created a mutilated populace. The poverty her father tried to fight remains the only constant in the war-torn land. A harsh critic of her father's executioners, Forna nevertheless equivocates on the dictatorships that have wreaked havoc throughout Africa, querying her own identity as a diaspora mixed-race Afro-European. Reminiscent of Isabelle Allende's House of the Spirits, Forna's work is a powerfully and elegantly written mix of complex history, riveting memoir and damning expos&#x201a;<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Readings to Accompany Experience Humanities Volume 1: Beginnings through the Renaissance</h2><p>Chronologically organized, this two-volume survey presents the cultural achievements of Western civilization--art, music, history, literature, theater, film, and the other arts--within their historical contexts.

In this powerful new look at modern China, Rana Mitter goes back to a pivotal moment in Chinese history to uncover the origins of the painful transition from pre-modern to modern world. <br> Mitter identifies May 4, 1919, as the defining moment of China's twentieth-century history. On that day, outrage over the Paris peace conference triggered a vast student protest that led in turn to "the May Fourth Movement." Just seven years before, the 2,000-year-old imperial system had collapsed. Now a new group of urban, modernizing thinkers began to reject Confucianism and traditional culture in general as hindrances in the fight against imperialism, warlordism, and the oppression of women and the poor. Forward-looking, individualistic, embracing youth, this "New Culture movement" made a lasting impact on the critical decades that followed: the 1940s, with the war against Japan and the civil war between the Nationalist Party and the Communists; the 1960s, with the bizarre, seemingly anarchic world of Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution; and the 1980s, with the rise of a semi-market economy against the backdrop of continued single-party rule and growing inequality. Throughout each of these dramatically different eras, the May 4 themes persisted, from the insanity of the Cultural Revolution to the recent romance with space-age technology.<br> China, Mitter concludes, still seems to be in search of a new narrative about what the country is, and what it should become. And May 4 remains a touchstone in that search.</p><p><br><strong>Rana Mitter</strong> is Lecturer in the History and Politics of Modern China at the University of Oxford, and a Fellow of St. Cross College. In addition to many books and journal articles, Mitter has contributed to documentaries on the History Channel and is involved in a forthcoming documentary on Kublai Khan.<br>This is a fascinating look at a pivotal time in the formation of the culture of modern China. The "Bitter Revolution" of the title is not the Communist Revolution of 1949 or the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s, but the revolution of ideas that climaxed in the mass anti-imperialist protests of May 4, 1919. Known as the May Fourth Movement, these student-led protests engendered tumultuous cultural eddies that disturbed all aspects of Chinese life. Mitter's focus on this underappreciated fulcrum of modern Chinese history is refreshing. Chinese Communist historiography has mythologized the May Fourth Movement as the youthful harbinger of the 1949 revolution. Mitter goes beyond such teleological myths to recapture the often desperate and heady atmosphere of the "New Culture Movement," which paralleled the political tumult. She reveals antecedents to later events, including developments as disparate as the Cultural Revolution and the recent decades of economic and cultural liberalization. Especially interesting were new attitudes toward gender relations, sexuality, marriage and family. In many ways, the individualism and experimentation of that era have more in common with contemporary China than the intervening decades of wartime and Communist collectivism and conformity&#x2014;a compelling reason why this history of early 20th-century China is so relevant today. What is most intriguing about Mitter's account is not what was lost in the dark decades that followed, but how much endured.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The &#x201c;truth&#x201d; asserted by partisan interests, he suggests, is invariably tinged with dishonesty&#x2015;whether by the outright mendacities of politicians and rulers (Steiner refers here to machinations of the British Empire), or by the manipulative techniques of secret societies intent on securing and shoring up their power. In relation to the secret societies, Steiner highlights how, whereas we tend to reject overt authority today, we also succumb more easily to its covert forms in the &#x201c;received wisdom&#x201d; we often adopt unthinkingly. In seeking to help his audiences discern the spiritual struggle unfolding behind outer events, Steiner describes how the intrigues that led to the war were based on intentional deceit that served hidden aims hidden mostly from the general public.<br><br>In contrast to the divisiveness of lies, truth is based on realizing the interconnectedness of all things&#x2015;interdependence between the realms &#x201c;below&#x201d; and &#x201c;above.&#x201d; The &#x201c;I,&#x201d; upon which all evolution on Earth is predicated, signifies victory over egoism and narrow self-interest, together with our imaginative embrace of all beings. Its spiritual reality&#x2015;which descends to us from non-material worlds and toward which we evolve through our earthly lives&#x2015;is the supreme truth.<br><br>In addition to his many other topics, Rudolf Steiner speaks about The Qur&#x2019;an and the Mystery of Golgotha; Henry VIII, Thomas More, and the Church of England; the Jesuits and their State in Paraguay; Freemasons, esoteric symbols, and secret handshakes; Madame Blavatsky&#x2019;s occult imprisonment by Anglo-Saxon brotherhoods; Dostoyevsky&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Brothers Karamazov;</i>&nbsp;and the occult literature of Papus and L�vi.<br></p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up. As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world.

Fleeing his celebrity, notoriety, and debts, he sought refuge in Europe, taking his young doctor with him. As an inexperienced medic with literary aspirations of his own, Doctor John Polidori could not believe his luck.<br><br> That summer another literary star also arrived in Geneva. With Percy Bysshe Shelley came his lover, Mary, and her step-sister, Claire Clairmont. For the next three months, this party of young bohemians shared their lives, charged with sexual and artistic tensions. It was a period of extraordinary creativity: Mary Shelley started writing <em>Frankenstein</em>, the gothic masterpiece of Romantic fiction; Byron completed <em>Childe</em><em>Harold&#x2019;s Pilgrimage</em>, his epic poem; and Polidori would begin <em>The Vampyre</em>, the first great vampire novel.<br><br> It was also a time of remarkable drama and emotional turmoil. For Byron and the Shelleys, their stay by the lake would serve to immortalize them in the annals of literary history. But for Claire and Polidori, the Swiss sojourn would scar them forever. 16 pages of color and B&amp;W photographs</p><p>Andrew McConnell Stott is the author of The Pantomime Life of Joseph Grimaldi, which won the Royal Society of Literature Prize, the Sheridan Morley Prize for Theatre Biography, and was a Guardian Best Book of the Year.

With the inquisitiveness of an investigative reporter and the emotional power of a novelist in his prime, Steinbeck toured the squatters' camps and Hoovervilles of California. Here he found once strong, independent farmers&#x2014;the backbone of rural America&#x2014;so reduced in dignity, beaten in spirit, sick, sullen, and defeated that they had been "cast down to a kind of subhumanity." He contrasts their misery with the hope offered by government resettlement camps, where self-help committees, child nurseries, quilting and sewing projects, and decent sanitation were restoring dignity and indeed saving lives. </p><p>_The Harvest Gypsies_ gives us an eyewitness account of the horrendous Dust Bowl migration, a major event in California history, and provides the factual foundation for Steinbeck's masterpiece, _The Grapes of Wrath_. Included are twenty-two photographs by Dorothea Lange and others, many of which accompanied Steinbeck's original articles.</p></p><p>John Steinbeck was born in Salinas, CA, in 1902. Steinbeck realized that the migration caused by the Dust Bowl was drastically changing the labor forces of California from the foreign "cheap labor" to a higher standard of living for the farm workers. He felt for these migrant workers, and with the help of a friend, Tom Collins, unsucessfully tried to get federal aid and sympathy, as shown in the articles of _The Harvest Gypsies_. Steinbeck continued in his crusade, publishing _The Grapes of Wrath_, for which he won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962. Steinbeck died in 1968 in New York City. <p>Charles Wollenberg is a noted historian and author of _Marinship at War: Shipbuilding and Social Change in Wartime Sausalito_ and _Golden Gate Metropolis: Perspectives in Bay Area History_.</p>In 1936, a San Francisco newspaper commissioned Steinbeck to write a week-long series of articles about California's underclass of white migrant farm workers, who became the models and the inspiration for The Grapes of Wrath. Reprinted here, Steinbeck's observations of migrant families and of their exploitation by wealthy agriculturists have not lost their potency. And as Wollenberg, a history professor at Vista College, Berkeley, Calif., points out, the plight of the newly destitute and newly homeless has particular relevance today. Steinbeck's journalism shares the enduring quality of his famous novel (but critics of Steinbeck will beware; his heavy-handed style is only slightly less obtrusive here). Especially interesting are the final articles, which analyze the history of California's migrant populations and propose federal programs to alleviate their distress. Steinbeck's outrage leads to an emotional indictment of then-current farm management as "a system of terrorism that would be unusual in the Fascist nations of the world." Certain to engage students of both American literature and labor history.

MOORE, Purdue University, USA</p><h2>Let the People See: The Story of Emmett Till</h2><p>The world knows the story of young Emmett Till. In August 1955, the fourteen-year-old Chicago boy supposedly flirted with a white woman named Carolyn Bryant, who worked behind the counter of a country store, while visiting family in Mississippi. Three days later, his mangled body was recovered in the Tallahatchie River, weighed down by a cotton-gin fan. Till's killers, Bryant's husband and his half-brother, were eventually acquitted on technicalities by an all-white jury despite overwhelming evidence. It seemed another case of Southern justice.<br><br>Then details of what had happened to Till became public, which they did in part because Emmett's mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, insisted that his casket remain open during his funeral. The world saw the horror, and Till's story gripped the country and sparked outrage. Black journalists drove down to Mississippi and risked their lives interviewing townsfolk, encouraging witnesses, spiriting those in danger out of the region, and above all keeping the news cycle turning. It continues to turn. In 2005, fifty years after the murder, the FBI reopened the case. New papers and testimony have come to light, and several participants, including Till's mother, have published autobiographies. Using this new evidence and a broadened historical context, Elliott J. Gorn delves more fully than anyone has into how and why the story of Emmett Till still resonates, and always will. Till's murder marked a turning point, Gorn shows, and yet also reveals how old patterns of thought and behavior endure, and why we must look hard at them.<br></p><p><br><strong>Elliott J.

Most of all though, [the book] is a vivid reminder of just how easy it is for people not to see things they'd rather not see."- Maureen Corrigan, <em>NPR/WHYY's Fresh Air</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Organic Church: Growing Faith Where Life Happens</h2><p>Churches have tried all kinds of ways to attract new and younger members - revised vision statements, hipper worship, contemporary music, livelier sermons, bigger and better auditoriums. But there are still so many people who aren't being reached, who don't want to come to church. And the truth is that attendance at church on Sundays does not necessarily transform lives; God's presence in our hearts is what changes us. Leaders and laypeople everywhere are realizing that they need new and more powerful ways to help them spread God's Word. According to international church starter and pastor Neil Cole, if we want to connect with young people and those who are not coming to church, we must go where people congregate. Cole shows readers how to plant the seeds of the Kingdom of God in the places where life happens and where culture is formed - restaurants, bars, coffeehouses, parks, locker rooms,and neighborhoods. <i>Organic Church</i> offers a hands-on guide for demystifying this new model of church and shows the practical aspects of implementing it.</p><p>Advance Praise for Organic Church <p>"This book is profound, practical, and a pleasure to read.

Completely contemporary, many of the scripts use metaphors that are especially meaningful in the world of young people, including computers, iPods, and Play Stations. Hypnotherapy is an effective and expedient approach for working with children in part because young people tend to be open to it. As the author points out, Children are accustomed to using their imagination they live in it on a daily basis. Thus, suggestions to visualize images or colors or to make characters bigger or smaller and so forth are easily accepted. By the same token, any of these carefully selected hypnotherapeutic scripts can be quickly adapted to the particular imagination and level of the young client. Throughout, possibilities and cautions are considered with respect to structuring sessions, determining when it is advisable to bring others into the treatment team, and choice of induction. Whether new to hypnotherapy or to working with this age group or perhaps looking for fresh ways to employ what you know 'Scripts &amp; Strategies in Hypnotherapy with Children' will contribute something essential to helping children (and parents) cope with issues such as: Low self-esteem, behavior problems, exam stress, bedwetting, soiling, fear of the dark, bullying, weak organizational or study skills, and much more. Solution-focused and reality tested, this collection of inductions, accompanied by illuminating explanations, will empower any treatment plan.</p><p>Lynda Hudson, a former teacher, is a clinical hypnosis practitioner who specializes in working with children. She is a lecturer at The London College of Clinicial Hypnosis, Thames Medical Lectures, and the ISIS Hypnotherapy Centre in Brighton, England.This book is a valuable resource for clinicians working hypnotically with children. It will assist anyone who has already achieved an advanced level of training in medicine, nursing, dentistry, or mental health with prior training in hypnosis to achieve greater confidence as they incorporate hypnotic skills and metaphors into their practice with children. Ms. Hudson s stories are delightfully imaginative; her language is permissive and she includes ego-strengthening in every script to foster self-esteem and self-efficacy.The book gives the clinician warm, caring, and developmentally appropriate strategies that help foster rapport and successful hypnotherapeutic interventions with children.

This book offers a sustained examination of the masculinism of contemporary geographical discourses.<br>Drawing on the work of feminist theories about the intersection of power, knowledge and subjectivity, Rose discusses different aspects of the discipline's masculinism in a series of essays that bring influential approaches in recent geography together with feminist accounts of the space of the everyday, the notion of a sense of place, and views of landscape. In the final chapter, she examines the spatial imagery of a variety of feminists in order to argue that the geographical imagination implicit in feminist discussions of the politics of location is one example of a geography that does not deny difference in the name of a universal masculinity.</p><p>Gillian Rose is lecturer in geography at Queen Mary and Westfield College, University of London.'It's very personal, very courageous, and very challenging.' <i>Derek Gregory, Professor of Geography at the University of British Columbia</i> <p>'.subtle and sophisticated.this is an important book.' <i>The Geographical Journal</i></p> <p>'This is an important book in the development of feminist geography.' <i>Geography</i></p> <p>'...

McPherson is acclaimed as one of the finest historians writing today and a preeminent commentator on the Civil War. <em>Battle Cry of Freedom</em>, his Pulitzer Prize-winning account of that conflict, was a national bestseller that Hugh Brogan, in <em>The New York Times</em>, called "history writing of the highest order." Now, in <em>Drawn With the Sword</em>, McPherson offers a series of thoughtful and engaging essays on some of the most enduring questions of the Civil War, written in the masterful prose that has become his trademark.<br><br>Filled with fresh interpretations, puncturing old myths and challenging new ones, <em>Drawn With the Sword</em> explores such questions as why the North won and why the South lost (emphasizing the role of contingency in the Northern victory), whether Southern or Northern aggression began the war, and who really freed the slaves, Abraham Lincoln or the slaves themselves. McPherson offers memorable portraits of the great leaders who people the landscape of the Civil War: Ulysses S. Grant, struggling to write his memoirs with the same courage and determination that marked his successes on the battlefield; Robert E. Lee, a brilliant general and a true gentleman, yet still a product of his time and place; and Abraham Lincoln, the leader and orator whose mythical figure still looms large over our cultural landscape. And McPherson discusses often-ignored issues such as the development of the Civil War into a modern "total war" against both soldiers and civilians, and the international impact of the American Civil War in advancing the cause of republicanism and democracy in countries from Brazil and Cuba to France and England. Of special interest is the final essay, entitled "What's the Matter With History?", a trenchant critique of the field of history today, which McPherson describes here as "more and more about less and less." He writes that professional historians have abandoned narrative history written for the greater audience of educated general readers in favor of impenetrable tomes on minor historical details which serve only to edify other academics, thus leaving the historical education of the general public to films and television programs such as <em>Glory</em> and Ken Burns's PBS documentary <em>The Civil War</em>.<br><br>Each essay in <em>Drawn With the Sword</em> reveals McPherson's own profound knowledge of the Civil War and of the controversies among historians, presenting all sides in clear and lucid prose and concluding with his own measured and eloquent opinions. Readers will rejoice that McPherson has once again proven by example that history can be both accurate and interesting, informative and well-written. Mark Twain wrote that the Civil War "wrought so profoundly upon the entire national character that the influence cannot be measured short of two or three generations." In <em>Drawn With the Sword</em>, McPherson gracefully and brilliantly illuminates this momentous conflict.<br></p><p>6 1.5-hour cassettesFilled with fresh interpretations, puncturing old myths and challenging new ones, Drawn With the Sword explores such questions as why the North won and why the South lost (emphasizing the role of contingency in the Northern victory), whether Southern or Northern aggression began the war, and who really freed the slaves, Abraham Lincoln or the slaves themselves.

He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature soon after its publication, and half a century later it is still one of his most read books.</p><p>Here, for a change, is a fish tale that actually does honour to the author. In fact <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> revived Ernest Hemingway's career, which was foundering under the weight of such post-war stinkers as <i>Across the River and into the Trees</i>. It also led directly to his receipt of the Nobel Prize in 1954 (an award Hemingway gladly accepted, despite his earlier observation that "no son of a bitch that ever won the Nobel Prize ever wrote anything worth reading afterwards"). A half century later, it's still easy to see why. This tale of an aged Cuban fisherman going head-to-head (or hand-to-fin) with a magnificent marlin encapsulates Hemingway's favourite motifs of physical and moral challenge. Yet Santiago is too old and infirm to partake of the gun-toting machismo that disfigured much of the author's later work: <blockquote> "The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords." </blockquote> Hemingway's style, too, reverts to those superb snapshots of perception that won him his initial fame: <blockquote> Just before it was dark, as they passed a great island of Sargasso weed that heaved and swung in the light sea as though the ocean were making love with something under a yellow blanket, his small line was taken by a dolphin. He saw it first when it jumped in the air, true gold in the last of the sun and bending and flapping wildly in the air. </blockquote> If a younger Hemingway had written this novella, Santiago most likely would have towed the enormous fish back to port and posed for a triumphal photograph--just as the author delighted in doing, circa 1935. Instead his prize gets devoured by a school of sharks. Returning with little more than a skeleton, he takes to his bed and, in the very last line, cements his identification with his creator: <blockquote> "The old man was dreaming about the lions." </blockquote> Perhaps there's some allegory of art and experience floating around in there somewhere--but <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> was, in any case, the last great catch of Hemingway's career. --<i>James Marcus</i>"It is unsurpassed in Hemingway's oeuvre.

David, Old Testament Shepherd, king, and psalmist, offers an answer in the shape of his own life.</p><p>In many ways he was a most extraordinary man?intelligent, handsome, abundantly gifted as a poet, musician, warrior, and administrator. Yet in other ways he was a most ordinary man?often gripped by destructive passion, rocked by family chaos and personal tragedy, and motivated by political expediency. How did David become the national hero of God's chosen people? Why is he the one character in the Bible described as "a man after God's own heart?" Chuck Swindoll explores the many facets of David?from his teenage years and dysfunctional family life to his overwhelming passion for God.</p><p>David's life offers hope to all of us. It shows that God can do extraordinary things through ordinary men and women. And <i>David</i> offers an insightful perspective on what it means to be truly spiritual, to become like David?men and women after God's own heart.</p><p><i>David </i>is the first of a multi-volume series exploring great lives from the Bible. Chuck Swindoll wants to show us that these men and women became great when they placed themselves at the Lord's disposal, allowing Him to develop within them the marks of true character: humility, purity, authenticity, and integrity. To live a life God considers "great" is within the reach of everyone who submits to him.</p></p><p><p>Charles R.

He currently pastors Stonebriar Community Church in Frisco, Texas, and serves as the chancellor of Dallas Theological Seminary. His renowned Insight for Living radio program airs around the world. Chuck and Cynthia, his partner in life and ministry, have four grown children and ten grandchildren.</p>The humble shepherd David later became the great King David, spoken of in the Bible. Michael Kramer contrasts young David&#39;s sins and poor choices with his later courage and devotion to God--which led to his being described as &#39;&#39;a man after God&#39;s own heart.&#39;&#39; After Kramer&#39;s versatile range and skill depicts David&#39;s mighty battle with Goliath, Swindoll advises listeners to use their personal memories of past victories for battles with their own giants. With succinct clarity Kramer delivers additional spiritual tips from the author: Don&#39;t fight using your own strength--rely on the Lord. Don&#39;t abuse God&#39;s grace. Listen when God says no. Don&#39;t be intimidated or overly sensitive.

The resources in the <i>Teacher Guide</i> will help students master and apply the skills learned in the <i>Student Textbook</i>. </p><p> What does this workbook include? <br> </p><ul> <li><b>Worksheets, Quizzes, and Tests:</b> These perforated, three-hole punched pages help provide practice on the principles taught in the main student text.</li> <li><b>Answers Keys:</b> The answers are included for the worksheets, quizzes, and tests found in this <i>Teacher Guide</i>.</li> <li><b>Schedule:</b> A suggested calendar schedule is provided for completing the material in one year, though this can be adapted to meet individual student needs.</li> </ul> <p> Are there any prerequisites for this course? <br> This curriculum is aimed at grades 6-8 (pre-algebra), fitting into most math approaches the year or two years prior to starting high school algebra. If following traditional grade levels, Book 1 should be completed in grade 6 or 7, and Book 2 in grade 7 or 8. </p><p> [Book 2] It is strongly recommended that students complete Book 1 before beginning <i>Book 2: Principles of Mathematics- Biblical Worldview Curriculum</i> as math builds on itself. Students don&#x2019;t just learn how to manipulate numbers on paper, but starting with arithmetic and laying the groundwork for geometry and algebra (covered in year 2), this curriculum both firms up the foundational concepts and prepares students for upper-level math in a logical, step-by-step way that helps students understand concepts, build problem-solving skills, and see how different aspects of math connect.</p></p><p>Katherine A.

The former should be about truth and understanding; the latter is mostly about moving product. Paul Weaver remembers. His argument is that contemporary journalism doesn&#39;t so much report on reality as it creates and markets the product called &#34;news,&#34; that is, reality strained to the breaking point through a distorting lens of crisis and emergency response. This slant tends to reduce journalism to a handmaiden of such centers of power as activist presidents and public relations-minded corporations. The remedy, concludes Weaver, is for the press to reorient itself toward readers rather than advertisers and to emphasize deliberative stories over crisis-oriented ones.A provocative mix of history, anecdote, and argument from a journalist and scholar who sees the conventions of the news business as leading to exercises of ``deceit, manipulation and exploitation.'' A former Fortune editor and corporate flack, Weaver (The Suicidal Corporation, 1987) is currently affiliated with the conservative Hoover Institution. But he owes as much to left-wing critiques of advertising-driven media as he does to right-wing arguments that reporters' reliance on ``crisis-and-emergency- response'' undercuts established authority. Joseph Pulitzer's 19th- century New York World, the first newspaper to abandon partisan ideology in order to attract a mass audience, began a trend in the media toward increasing claims of objectivity. Weaver argues that such claims, magnified by the advent of television news, require a symbiotic relationship between major news organizations and government institutions. He ably uncovers the false objectivity of news stories and shows how newspapers rely on ``scripts'' provided by newsmakers and ``pseudoevents.'' Drawing on his own experience, he shows how editors shape news and constrict reporters, and how reporters' disowning of their own politics and judgments turns them from rebels into toadies. Wanting to restore journalists to their ``true role as citizen[s],'' he offers some worthy suggestions for both the fabricators and the consumers of news: Instead of covering crises, journalists should analyze institutional action; reporters shouldn't socialize with sources; newspapers should emulate their European counterparts that have political identities; consumers should draw on a range of media, including opinion magazines and C- SPAN. Weaver's survey is incomplete (he doesn't discuss the alternative press), but he does see the media as crucial to the survival of democracy. This book should trouble the soul of any self-reflective journalist and help reframe the business of press criticism. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Nontechnical yet sophisticated, Absolute Returns shows investors how to make educated decisions about hedge fund investment--thoroughly explaining the risks as well as the rewards.</p><p>"The world of investing floats on a vast sea of words, most of which are obvious, simple-minded, and clich�s, and all of those are dangerous to financial health. The story in this book bears no relation to all that stuff. Ineichen's message is original, powerful, comprehensive, and essential to robust financial health. The literary clarity he blends with his financial wisdom is an additional blessing."<br> -Peter L. Bernstein, President, Peter L. Bernstein, Inc.,<br> author of Against the Gods and The Power of Gold<br> <br> "No one can afford to risk money in hedge funds without reading this comprehensive guide.

In other words, the hedge fund business is about absolute returns. But not all hedge funds are created equal. A poorly chosen hedge fund or portfolio of hedge funds can produce disappointing results.<br> <br> In Absolute Returns: The Risk and Opportunities of Hedge Fund Investing, Alexander Ineichen-Head of Equity Derivatives Research for UBS Warburg in London and author of the widely read research publication In Search of Alpha: Investing in Hedge Funds-demystifies what hedge funds are, how they invest to generate superior risk-adjusted returns, and what the concurrent risks of investing in them are.<br> <br> Divided into four comprehensive parts . . .<br> <br> Part I: The Hedge Fund Industry<br> <br> Part II: Risk and Opportunities of Absolute Return Strategies<br> <br> Part III: The Fund of Hedge Funds Industry<br> <br> Part IV: Going Forward<br> <br> . . . this book will introduce you to the new investment paradigm of absolute returns, outline the risk and opportunities of absolute return strategies, dispel the myths and misconceptions that have surrounded hedge funds, and provide a detailed look at the advantages and disadvantages of hedge fund investing.<br> <br> Besides focusing on the characteristics and performance of single hedge funds, Absolute Returns also discusses the fund of hedge funds approach, a strategy in which a single fund invests in a portfolio of hedge funds. Ineichen explores the fund of hedge funds industry, the vehicles within this industry, as well as the potential for alpha in a fund of hedge funds.<br> <br> There are essentially two main reasons to invest in hedge funds: superior performance and diversification. Absolute Returns will help you understand each of these topics as well as a number of other hedge fund issues you must be familiar with in order to succeed in this arena. Filled with helpful charts, real-world examples, and an informative appendix for each chapter, Absolute Returns will allow you to make more educated decisions about hedge fund investments.</p><h2>Chemical Curiosities</h2><p>Could it be magic...? Chemical experiments are not only essential for teaching chemistry, they also fascinate the audience. This book is an excellent source of inspiration for every 'magic show' and classroom demonstration. In a very playful manner, the experiments described here open up the manifold, colourful, and sometimes ear-splitting world of chemistry. Ranging from unusual (but useful) properties of matter to the illustration of the greenhouse effect, this masterful chemist's 'cookbook' is highly suitable for preparing demonstrations in front of larger audiences. Building a bridge between science and the arts, every experiment is introduced by inspiring citations from prose and poetry, which makes reading and experimenting equally enjoyable.<br> <br> 'The remarkable achievement of Herbert Roesky's and Klaus M�ckel's book is the linkage it achieves between the world of the human spirit, expressed in literature and historical continuity, and the art of chemical demonstration.

You can practice it anywhere &#x2013; at home, work, in prison, on a deserted island &#x2013; provided you have a pencil and a scrap of paper. </p><p>I believe that beginners first come to poetry as an art partly because they already own the tools to make it. If you can read and write, chances are you also can pen a poem. But there&#x2019;s a misconception that a pen and paper is all you need. A great poem takes more than just the ability to form legible words with a ballpoint. Much more. </p><p>This book will take you though the skills you require to become a good poet. I can&#x2019;t promise you greatness and fame, but I can promise you that you&#x2019;ll learn the parts and pieces that make up a poem &#x2013; the feeling and inspiration are between you and your muse.

Franklin compiled and self-published his own venerated advice and proverbs on personal finance from <i>Poor Richard&#x2019;s Almanack</i>. Since its appearance as a pamphlet in 1758, it has been reprinted and translated countless times. This new edition includes not only his counsel on financial planning, investment, prudence, and retirement strategies, but also essays and annotations about the legendary American entrepreneur himself. Additionally, it features facsimile pages of the original typed text, with adjacent pages providing modern translations for a 21st century audience.

In <i>The Black Riders</i> (1895), <i>War Is Kind</i> (1899), and the best of his uncollected poems, Crane forged his own idiom: abrupt, compact, sharply visual, and brutally indifferent to the niceties of late Victorian verse. These spontaneous utterances-Crane said they came to him "in little rows, all made up, ready to be put down on paper," sometimes five or six a day-seem now like a prophetic blast of the modernist era and of the great war poetry that was to follow.<br><br><b>About the American Poets Project</b><br>Elegantly designed in compact editions, printed on acid-free paper, and textually authoritative, the American Poets Project makes available the full range of the American poetic accomplishment, selected and introduced by today&#x2019;s most discerning poets and critics.</p><p>Stephen Crane (1871&#x2013;1900) was active as a reporter around the world in addition to being an acclaimed novelist.&#x201c;This collection of poetry is fascinating, it more ambitiously, in his words, addresses the concerns of Crane&#x2019;s prose . . .

Under the pseudonym Richard Stark, he wrote twenty-four fast-paced, hardboiled novels featuring Parker, a shrewd career criminal with a talent for heists. Using the same nom de plume, Westlake also completed a separate series in the Parker universe, starring Alan Grofield, an occasional colleague of Parker. While he shares events and characters with several Parker novels, Grofield is less calculating and more hot-blooded than Parker; think fewer guns, more dames.<br> <br></p> <p>Not that there isn&#x2019;t violence and adventure aplenty. <i>The Damsel</i> begins directly after the Parker novel <i>The Handle</i>.

Schoolmate of Hegel and Schelling, Holderlin&#39;s poems contain threads of philosophical thinking and Greek dramatic themes. Holderlin wrote Hyperion, his only extended prose work, shortly before being institutionalized for his mental instabilities.

Every morning I am now on the heights of the Corinthian Isthmus and, like a bee among flowers, my soul often flies back and forth between the seas that, to the right and left, cool the feet of my glowing mountains. One of the two gulfs especially should have delighted me, had I stood here a millennium ago. Between the glorious wilderness of Helicon and Parnassus where daybreak plays among a hundred snow-covered peaks and the paradisiacal plain of Sicyon, the shining gulf surged like a triumphant demigod toward the city of joy, youthful Corinth, and poured out the captured riches of all regions before its darling. But what is that to me? The cry of the jackal that sings its wild dirge among the stone heaps of antiquity startles me out of my dreams. Joy to the man whose heart is delighted and strengthened by a flourishing fatherland. I feel as if I were cast into the mire, as if the coffin lid were slammed shut over me, whenever someone reminds me of my own; and whenever someone calls me a Greek, I feel as if he throttled me with a dog collar.</p>
